owed its dominance Italy primarily two influential Netherlandish composers Guillaume Dufay and Josquin des Prez who had spent significant portions their careers there Italy itself had yet produce

into partnership with the shops young apprentice and together they made killing the market His wife invested 500 scudi into the business which she later withdrew and lent back Palestrina eightpercent interest owned four houses which rented out quiet tenants Palestrina was very busy the mornings minded the fur store and unplugged his tenants toilets the afternoons composed motets and masses somehow found time write Masses and 500 Motets not mention the four books madrigals and other assorted church music The madrigals were bit embarrassing since everyone expected him the champion pure church music later admitted that had written them with the words blush and grieve Palestrina was able compose prolifically until his 1594 death Rome pleurisy was usual Palestrina was buried the same day died plain coffin with lead plate which was inscribed Libera Domine fivepart psalm for three choirs was sung the funeral Palestrinas funeral was held Peters and was buried beneath the floor the basilica His tomb was later covered new construction and attempts locate the site have been unsuccessful Palestrina left hundreds compositions including 105 masses offertories least 140 madrigals and more than 300 motets addition there are least hymns magnificats litanies and four five sets lamentations The Gloria melody from Palestrinas Magnificat Tertii Toni 1591 widely used today the resurrection hymn tune Victory The Strife Oer His attitude toward madrigals was somewhat enigmatic whereas the preface his collection Canticum canticorum Song Songs motets 1584 renounced the setting profane texts only two years later was back print with Book his secular madrigals some these being among the finest compositions the medium published just two collections madrigals with profane texts one 1555 and another 1586 The other two collections were spiritual madrigals genre beloved the proponents the CounterReformation Palestrinas masses show how his compositional style developed over time His Missa sine nomine seems have been particularly attractive Johann Sebastian Bach who studied and performed while writing the Mass minor Most Palestrinas masses appeared thirteen volumes printed between 1554 and 1601 the last seven published after his death One his most important works the Missa Papae Marcelli Pope Marcellus Mass has been historically associated with erroneous information involving the Council Trent According this tale which forms the basis Hans Pfitzners opera Palestrina was composed order persuade the Council Trent that draconian ban the polyphonic treatment text sacred music opposed that more directly intelligible homophonic treatment was unnecessary However more recent scholarship shows that this mass was fact composed before the cardinals convened discuss the ban possibly much ten years before Historical data indicates that the Council Trent official body never actually banned any church music and failed make any ruling official statement the subject These stories originated from the unofficial pointsofview some Council attendees who discussed their ideas with those not privy the Councils deliberations Those opinions and rumors have over centuries been transmuted into fictional accounts put into print and often incorrectly taught historical fact While Palestrinas compositional motivations are not known may have been quite conscious the need for intelligible text however this was not conform with any doctrine the CounterReformation because such doctrine exists His characteristic style remained consistent from the 1560s until the end his life Roches hypothesis that Palestrinas seemingly dispassionate approach expressive emotive texts could have resulted from his having produce many order from deliberate decision that any intensity expression was unbecoming church music reflects modern expectations about expressive freedom and underestimates the extent which the mood Palestrinas settings adapted the liturgical occasions for which the texts were set rather than the linebyline meaning the text and depends the distinctive characters the church modes and variations vocal grouping for expressive effect Performing editions and recordings Palestrina have tended favour his works the more familiar modes and standard SATB voicings underrepresenting the expressive variety his settings There are two comprehensive editions Palestrinas works 33volume edition published Breitkopf and Hrtel Leipzig Germany between 1862 and 1894 edited Franz Xaver Haberl and 34volume edition published the mid twentieth century Fratelli Scalera Rome Italy edited Casimiri and others One the hallmarks Palestrinas music that dissonances are typically relegated the weak beats measure This produced smoother and more consonant type polyphony which now considered definitive late Renaissance music given Palestrinas position Europes leading composer along with Orlande Lassus the wake Josquin des Prez 1521 The Palestrina style taught college courses covering Renaissance counterpoint often based the codification the 18thcentury composer and theorist Johann Joseph Fux published Gradus Parnassum Steps Parnassus 1725 Citing Palestrina his model Fux divided counterpoint into five species hence the term species counterpoint designed exercises for the student which deployed progressively more elaborate rhythmic combinations voices while adhering strict harmonic and melodic requirements The method was widely adopted and was the main basis contrapuntal training the 19th century but Fux had introduced number simplifications the Palestrina style notably the obligatory use cantus firmus semibreves which were corrected later authors such Knud Jeppesen and Morris Palestrinas music conforms many ways Fuxs rules particularly the fifth species but does not fit his pedagogical format The main insight that the pure style polyphony achieved Palestrina followed invariable set stylistic and combinational requirements was justified Fuxs manual was endorsed his contemporary Bach who himself arranged two Palestrinas masses for performance According Fux Palestrina had established and followed these basic guidelines Not mentioned Fux was the manner which the musical phrasing Palestrina followed the syntax the sentences was setting musicsomething not always observed earlier composers Also noticed Palestrina great deal tone painting Elementary examples this are descending musical motion with latin words like descendit descends static musical cadential moment with the words coelis from heaven Palestrina was extremely famous his day and anything his reputation and influence increased after his death Bach studied and handcopied Palestrinas first book Masses and 1742 wrote his own adaption the Kyrie and Gloria the Missa sine nomine Felix Mendelssohn placed him the pantheon the greatest musicians writing always get upset when some praise only Beethoven others only Palestrina and still others only Mozart Bach All four them say none all Conservative music the Roman school continued written Palestrinas style which the 17th century came known the prima pratica such students his Giovanni Maria Nanino Ruggiero Giovanelli Arcangelo Crivelli Teofilo Gargari Francesco Soriano and Gregorio Allegri late the 1750s Palestrinas style was still the reference for composers working the motet form can seen Francesco Barsantis Sei Antifones the style Palestrina 1750 published Peter Welcker 1762 Much research Palestrina was done the 19th century Giuseppe Baini who published monograph 1828 which made Palestrina famous again and reinforced the already existing legend that was the Saviour Church Music during the reforms the Council Trent 20th and 21st century scholarship and large retains the view that Palestrina was strong and refined composer whose music represents summit technical perfection Contemporary analysis highlighted the modern qualities the compositions Palestrina such research color and sonority use sonic grouping largescale setting interest vertical well horizontal organization studied attention text setting These unique characteristics together with effortless delivery and indefinable otherness constitute this day the attraction Palestrinas work 2009 film about the composer was produced German television ZDFArte Title Palestrina Prince Music directed Georg Brintrup
