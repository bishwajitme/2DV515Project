child prodigy defined psychology research literature person under the age ten who produces meaningful output some domain the level adult expert performer The term wunderkind from German Wunderkind literally wonder child sometimes used synonym for child prodigy particularly media accounts Wunderkind also used recognize those who achieve success and acclaim early their adult careers PET scans performed several mathematics prodigies have suggested that they think terms longterm working memory LTWM This memory specific field expertise capable holding relevant information for extended periods usually hours For example experienced waiters have been found hold the orders twenty customers their heads while they serve them but perform only well average person numbersequence recognition The PET scans also answer questions about which specific areas the brain associate themselves with manipulating numbers One subject never excelled child mathematics but taught himself algorithms and tricks for calculatory speed becoming capable extremely complex mental math His brain compared six other controls was studied using the PET scan revealing separate areas his brain that manipulated solve the complex problems Some the areas that and presumably prodigies use are brain sectors dealing visual and spatial memory well visual mental imagery Other areas the brain showed use the subject including sector the brain generally related childlike finger counting probably used his mind relate numbers the visual cortex Saul Kripke response invitation apply for teaching position Harvard Noting that the cerebellum acts streamline the speed and efficiency all thought processes Vandervert explained the abilities prodigies terms the collaboration working memory and the cognitive functions the cerebellum Citing extensive imaging evidence Vandervert first proposed this approach two publications which appeared 2003 addition imaging evidence Vanderverts approach supported the substantial awardwinning studies the cerebellum Masao Ito Vandervert provided extensive argument that the prodigy the transition from visualspatial working memory other forms thought language art mathematics accelerated the unique emotional disposition the prodigy and the cognitive functions the cerebellum According Vandervert the emotiondriven prodigy commonly observed rage master the cerebellum accelerates the streamlining the efficiencies working memory its manipulation and decompositionrecomposition visualspatial content into language acquisition and into linguistic mathematical and artistic precocity Essentially Vandervert has argued that when child confronted with challenging new situation visualspatial working memory and speechrelated and other notational systemrelated working memory are decomposed and recomposed fractionated the cerebellum and then blended the cerebral cortex attempt deal with the new situation child prodigies Vandervert believes this blending process accelerated due their unique emotional sensitivities which result high levels repetitious focus most cases particular rulegoverned knowledge domains has also argued that child prodigies first began appear about 10000 years ago when rulegoverned knowledge had accumulated significant point perhaps the agriculturalreligious settlements Gbekli Tepe Cyprus Some researchers believe that prodigious talent tends arise result the innate talent the child and the energetic and emotional investment that the child ventures Others believe that the environment plays the dominant role many times obvious ways For example Lszl Polgr set out raise his children chess players and all three his daughters went become worldclass players two whom are grandmasters emphasizing the potency childs environment can have determining the pursuits toward which childs energy will directed and showing that incredible amount skill can developed through suitable training But the other hand George Frideric Handel was example the natural talent had discovered such strong propensity music that his father who always intended him for the study the Civil Law had reason alarmed strictly forbade him meddle with any musical instrument but Handel found means get little clavichord privately conveyd room the top the house this room constantly stole when the family was asleep Despite his fathers opposition Handel became skillful performer the harpsichord and pipe organ Prodigiousness childhood not always maintained into adulthood Some researchers have found that gifted children fall behind due lack effort Jim Taylor professor the University San Francisco theorizes that this because gifted children experience success early age with little effort and may not develop sense ownership success Therefore these children might not develop connection between effort and outcome Some children might also believe that they can succeed without effort the future well Anders Ericcson professor Florida State University researches expert performance sports music mathematics and other activities His findings demonstrate that prodigiousness childhood not strong indicator later success Rather the number hours devoted the activity was better indicator Rosemary CallardSzulgit and other educators have written extensively about the problem perfectionism bright children calling their number one socialemotional trait Gifted children often associate even slight imperfection with failure that they become fearful effort even their personal lives and extreme cases end virtually immobilized Gifted children will sometimes have their own unique set needs and can often struggle nonacademic areas Since these children are usually viewed natural achievers can even more difficult for them receive the special assistance they need areas not directly related academic performance most cases there are five specific special needs common children who are identified gifted Gifted children often struggle with interpersonal relationships with peers They may find difficult relate others and may recognize that they are different than most children Thus these children might view themselves needing separate Gifted children often have trouble paying attention class which can result with mixed diagnosis ADD ADHD Although its possible for gifted child have these disorders careful diagnostic measures must taken Gifted children often lack motivation complete certain tasks they feel that they are not being challenged enough When gifted children arent provided with engaging material their lack focus may perceived attention deficit disorder Children who equate their performance with their selfworth often become perfectionists and struggle perform their own ideal standard often setting bars for themselves that are too high and becoming angry upset even depressed when they fail meet their own expectations Specialists theorize that the spoken word can difficult for some gifted children because they have the added task translating the complex ideas their heads into language that others similar age can understand This process can lead abnormal hesitation when speaking stuttering and frustration the part the child
