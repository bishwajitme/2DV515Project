aulos Ancient Greek plural auloi tibia Latin was ancient Greek wind instrument depicted often art and also attested archaeology aulete aults was the musician who performed aulos The ancient Roman equivalent was the tibicen plural tibicines from the Latin tibia pipe aulos The neologism aulode sometimes used analogy with rhapsode and citharode citharede refer aulos player who may also called aulist however aulode more commonly refers singer who sang the accompaniment piece played the aulos There were several kinds aulos single double The most common variety was reed instrument Archeological finds surviving iconography and other evidence indicate that was doublereeded like the modern oboe but with larger mouthpiece like the surviving Armenian duduk single pipe without reed was called the monaulos from single single pipe held horizontally the modern flute was the plagiaulos from sideways pipe with bag allow for continuous sound that bagpipe was the askaulos from askos wineskin Though aulos often erroneously translated flute was doublereeded instrument and its sound described penetrating insisting and exciting was more akin that the bagpipes with chanter and modulated drone Like the Great Highland Bagpipe the aulos has been used for martial music but more frequently depicted other social settings was the standard accompaniment the passionate elegiac poetry also accompanied physical activities such wrestling matches the broad jump the discus throw and mark the rowing cadence triremes well sacrifices and dramas Plato associates with the ecstatic cults Dionysus and the Korybantes banning from his Republic but reintroducing Laws appears that some variants the instrument were loud shrill and therefore very hard blow leather strap called phorbei Greek capistrum Latin was worn horizontally around the head with hole for the mouth the auletai help support the lips and avoid excessive strain the cheeks due continuous blowing Sometimes second strap was used over the top the head prevent the phorbei from slipping down Aulos players are sometimes depicted with puffed cheeks The playing technique almost certainly made use circular breathing very much like the Sardinian launeddas and Armenian duduk and this would give the aulos continuous sound Although aristocrats with sufficient leisure sometimes practiced aulosplaying they did the lyre after the later fifth century the aulos became chiefly associated with professional musicians often slaves Nevertheless such musicians could achieve fame The RomanoGreek writer Lucian discusses aulos playing his dialogue Harmonides which Alexander the Greats aulete Timotheus discusses fame with his pupil Harmonides Timotheus advises him impress the experts within his profession rather than seek popular approval big public venues leading musicians admire him popular approval will follow However Lucian reports that Harmonides died from excessive blowing during practicing myth Marsyas the satyr was supposed have invented the aulos else picked after Athena had thrown away because caused her cheeks puff out and ruined her beauty any case challenged Apollo musical contest where the winner would able whatever wanted the loserMarsyass expectation typical satyr was that this would sexual nature But Apollo and his lyre beat Marsyas and his aulos And since the pure lord Delphis mind worked different ways from Marsyass celebrated his victory stringing his opponent from tree and flaying him alive King Midas was cursed with donkeys ears for judging Apollo the lesser player Marsyass blood and the tears the Muses formed the river Marsyas Asia Minor This tale was warning against committing the sin hubris overweening pride that Marsyas thought might win against god Strange and brutal this myth reflects great many cultural tensions that the Greeks expressed the opposition they often drew between the lyre and aulos freedom servility and tyranny leisured amateurs professionals moderation sophrosyne excess etc Some this result 19th century classical interpretation Apollo versus Dionysus Reason represented the kithara opposed Madness represented the aulos the temple Apollo Delphi there was also shrine Dionysus and his Maenads are shown drinking cups playing the aulos but Dionysus sometimes shown holding kithara lyre modern interpretation can little more complicated than just simple dualitycitation needed This opposition mostly Athenian one might surmised that things were different Thebes which was center aulosplaying Sparta which had Bacchic Korybantic cults serve contrast the aulos was actually associated with Apollo and accompanied the hoplites into battle The battle scene the Chigi vase shows aulos player setting lyrical rhythm for the hoplite phalanx advance This accompaniment reduced the possibility opening the formation the blockage the aulete had fundamental role insuring the integrity the phalanx this particular scene the phalanx approaching from the left
