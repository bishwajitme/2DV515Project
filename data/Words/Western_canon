canon remains represented idea many institutions though its implications continue debated Defenders maintain that those who undermine the canon out primarily political interests and that such criticisms are misguided andor disingenuous John Searle Professor Emeritus Philosophy the University California Berkeley has written There certain irony this politicized objections the canon that earlier student generations own for example found the critical tradition that runs from Socrates through the Federalist Papers through the writings Mill and Marx down the twentieth century liberating from the stuffy conventions traditional American politics and pieties Precisely inculcating critical attitude the canon served demythologize the conventional pieties the American bourgeoisie and provided the student with perspective from which critically analyze American culture and institutions Ironically the same tradition now regarded oppressive The texts once served unmasking function now are told that the texts which must unmasked One the main objections canon literature the question authority who should have the power determine what works are worth reading Searles rebuttal suggests that one obvious difficulty with arguments against hierarchical ranking books that were valid would argue against any set required readings whatever indeed any list you care make about anything automatically creates two categories those that are the list and those that are not Charles Altieri the University California Berkeley states that canons are institutional form for exposing people

are always communal nature that there are limited canons for say literature survey class English department reading list but there such thing one absolute canon literature Instead there are many conflicting canons regards Blooms Western Canon personal canon only The process defining the boundaries the canon endless The philosopher John Searle has said experience there never was fact fixed canon there was rather certain set tentative judgments about what had importance and quality Such judgments are always subject revision and fact they were constantly being revised One the notable
