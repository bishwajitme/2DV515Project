Musique concrte French pronunciation meaning concrete music form musique exprimentale experimental music Palombini 1998 542not citation given that exploits acousmatic listening meaning sound identities can often intentionally obscured appear unconnected their source cause can feature sounds derived from recordings musical instruments the human voice and the natural environment well those created using synthesizers and computerbased digital signal processing Compositions this idiom are not restricted the normal musical rules melody harmony rhythm metre and Originally contrasted with pure elektronische Musik based solely the production and manipulation electronically produced sounds rather than recorded sounds the theoretical basis musique concrte compositional practice was developed Pierre Schaeffer beginning the early 1940s From the late 1960s onward and particularly France the term acousmatic music musique acousmatique started used reference fixed media compositions that utilized both musique concrte based techniques and live sound spatialisation 1928 music critic Andr Curoy wrote his book Panorama Contemporary Music that perhaps the time not far off when composer will able represent through recording music specifically composed for the gramophone Curoy 1928 162 the same period the American composer Henry Cowell referring the projects Nikolai Lopatnikoff believed that there was wide field open for the composition music for phonographic discs This sentiment was echoed further 1930 Igor Stravinsky when stated the revue Kultur und Schallplatte that there will greater interest creating music way that will peculiar the gramophone record The following year 1931 Boris Schloezer also expressed the opinion that one could write for the gramophone for the wireless just one can for the piano the violin Battier 2007 190 Shortly after German art theorist Rudolf Arnheim discussed the effects microphonic recording essay entitled Radio published 1936 the idea creative role for the recording medium was introduced and Arnheim stated that The rediscovery the musicality sound noise and language and the reunification music noise and language order obtain unity material that one the chief artistic tasks radio Battier 2007 193 1942 French composer and theoretician Pierre Schaeffer began his exploration radiophony when joined Jacques Copeau and his pupils the foundation the Studio dEssai Radiodiffusion nationale The studio originally functioned center for the Resistance movement French radio which August 1944 was responsible for the first broadcasts liberated Paris was here that Schaeffer began experiment with creative radiophonic techniques using the sound technologies the time Palombini 1993 The development Schaeffers practice was informed encounters with voice actors and microphone usage and radiophonic art played important part inspiring and consolidating Schaeffers conception soundbased composition Dack 1994 311 Another important influence Schaeffers practice was cinema and the techniques recording and montage which were originally associated with cinematographic practice came serve the substrate musique concrte Marc Battier notes that prior Schaeffer Jean Epstein drew attention the manner which sound recording revealed what was hidden the act basic acoustic listening Epsteins reference this phenomenon epiphanic being which appears through the transduction sound proved influential Schaeffers concept reduced listening Schaeffer would explicitly cite Jean Epstein with reference his use extramusical sound material Epstein had already imagined that through the transposition natural sounds becomes possible create chords and dissonances melodies and symphonies noise which are new and specifically cinematographic music Battier 2007 191 Perhaps earlier than Schaeffer conducting his preliminary experiments into sound manipulation assuming these were later than 1944 and not early the foundation the Studio dEssai 1942 was the activity Egyptian composer Halim ElDabh student Cairo the early mid1940s began experimenting with tape music using cumbersome wire recorder recorded the sounds ancient zaar ceremony and the Middle East Radio studios processed the material using reverberation echo voltage controls and rerecording The resulting tapebased composition entitled The Expression Zaar was presented 1944 art gallery event Cairo ElDabh has described his initial activities attempt unlock the inner sound the recordings While his early compositional work was not widely known outside Egypt the time ElDabh would eventually gain recognition for his influential work the ColumbiaPrinceton Electronic Music Center the late 1950s Holmes 2008 15657 Following Schaeffers work with Studio dEssai Radiodiffusion Nationale during the early 1940s was credited with originating the theory and practice musique concrte The Studio dEssai was renamed Club dEssai RadiodiffusionTlvision Franaise Anon 1946 and the same year Schaeffer discussed writing the question surrounding the transformation time perceived through recording The essay evidenced knowledge sound manipulation techniques would further exploit compositionally 1948 Schaeffer formally initiated research noises the Club dEssai Palombini 1993 and October 1948 the results his initial experimentation were premiered concert given Paris Chion 1983 Five works for phonograph known collectively Cinq tudes bruitsFive Studies Noises including Etude violette Study Purple and Etude aux chemins fer Study the Railroads were presented 1949 Schaeffers compositional work was known publicly musique concrte Palombini 1993 Schaeffer stated when proposed the term musique concrte intended point out opposition with the way musical work usually goes Instead notating musical ideas paper with the symbols solfege and entrusting their realization wellknown instruments the question was collect concrete sounds wherever they came from and abstract the musical values they were potentially containing Reydellet 1996 According Pierre Henry musique concrte was not study timbre focused envelopes forms must presented means nontraditional characteristics you see one might say that the origin this music also found the interest plastifying music rendering plastic like sculpturemusique concrte opinion led manner composing indeed new mental framework composing James 1981 Schaeffer had developed aesthetic that was centred upon the use sound primary compositional resource The aesthetic also emphasised the importance play jeu the practice sound based composition Schaeffers use the word jeu from the verb jouer carries the same double meaning the English verb play enjoy oneself interacting with ones surroundings well operate musical instrument Dack 2002 1951 the work Schaeffer composerpercussionist Pierre Henry and sound engineer Jacques Poullin had received official recognition and The Groupe Recherches Musique Concrte Club Essai RadiodiffusionTlvision Franaise was established RTF Paris the ancestor the ORTF Lange 2009 173 RTF the GRMC established the first purposebuilt electroacoustic music studio quickly attracted many who either were were later become notable composers including Olivier Messiaen Pierre Boulez Jean Barraqu Karlheinz Stockhausen Edgard Varse Iannis Xenakis Michel Philippot and Arthur Honegger Compositional output from 1951 1953 comprised tude 1951 and tude 1951 Boulez Timbresdures 1952 Messiaen Konkrete Etde 1952 Stockhausen microphone bien tempr 1952 and voile dOrphe 1953 Henry tude 1953 Philippot tude 1953 Barraqu the mixed pieces Toute lyre 1951 and Orphe 1953 SchaefferHenry and the film music Masquerage 1952 Schaeffer and Astrologie 1953 Henry 1954 Varse and Honegger visited work the tape parts Dserts and rivire endormie Palombini 1999 the early and mid 1950s Schaeffers commitments RTF included official missions which often required extended absences from the studios This led him invest Philippe Arthuys with responsibility for the GRMC his absence with Pierre Henry operating Director Works Pierre Henrys composing talent developed greatly during this period the GRMC and worked with experimental filmmakers such Max Haas Jean Grmillon Enrico Fulchignoni and Jean Rouch and with choreographers including Dick Sanders and Maurice Bjart Gayou 2007 206 Schaeffer returned run the group the end 1957 and immediately stated his disapproval the direction the GRMC had taken proposal was then made renew completely the spirit the methods and the personnel the Group with view undertake research and offer much needed welcome young composers Gayou 2007 207 Following the emergence differences within the GRMC Pierre Henry Philippe Arthuys and several their colleagues resigned April 1958 Schaeffer created new collective called Groupe Recherches Musicales GRM and set about recruiting new members including Luc Ferrari Beatriz Ferreyra FranoisBernard Mche Iannis Xenakis Bernard Parmegiani and Mireille ChamassKyrou Later arrivals included Ivo Malec Philippe Carson Romuald Vandelle Edgardo Canton and Franois Bayle Gayou 2007 207 GRM was one several theoretical and experimental groups working under the umbrella the Schaefferled Service Recherche ORTF 196074 Together with the GRM three other groups existed the Groupe Recherches Image GRI the Groupe Recherches Technologiques GRT and the Groupe Recherches Langage which became the Groupe dEtudes Critiques Gayou 2007 207 Communication was the one theme that unified the various groups all which were devoted production and creation terms the question who says what whom Schaeffer added how thereby creating platform for research into audiovisual communication and mass media audible phenomena and music general including nonWestern musics Beatriz Ferreyra new preface Schaeffer and Reibel 1967 reedition 1998 the GRM the theoretical teaching remained based practice and could summed the catch phrase and listen Gayou 2007 207 Schaeffer kept practice established with the GRMC delegating the functions though not the title Group Director colleagues Since 1961 GRM has had six Group Directors Michel Philippot 196061 Luc Ferrari 196263 Bernard Baschet and Franois Vercken 196466 From the beginning 1966 Franois Bayle took over the direction for the duration thirtyone years 1997 was then replaced Daniel Teruggi Gayou 2007 206 The group continued refine Schaeffers ideas and strengthened the concept musique acousmatique Peignot 1960 11123 Schaeffer had borrowed the term acousmatic from Pythagoras and defined Acousmatic adjective referring sound that one hears without seeing the causes behind Schaeffer 1966 1966 Schaeffer published the book Trait des objets musicaux Treatise Musical Objects which represented the culmination some years research the field musique concrte conjunction with this publication set sound recordings was produced entitled solfge lobjet sonore Music Theory the Acoustic Object provide examples concepts dealt with the treatise The development musique concrte was facilitated the emergence new music technology postwar Europe Access microphones phonographs and later magnetic tape recorders created 1939 and acquired the Schaeffers Groupe Recherche Musique Concrte Research Group Concrete Music 1952 facilitated association with the French national broadcasting organization that time the RadiodiffusionTlvision Franaise gave Schaeffer and his colleagues opportunity experiment with recording technology and tape manipulation 1948 typical radio studio consisted series shellac record players shellac record recorder mixing desk with rotating potentiometers mechanical reverberation filters and microphones This technology made number limited operations available composer Teruggi 2007pageneeded The application the above technologies the creation musique concrte led the development number sound manipulation techniques including Teruggi 2007pageneeded The first tape recorders started arriving ORTF 1949 however their functioning was much less reliable than the shellac players the point that the Symphonie pour homme seul which was composed 195051 was mainly composed with records even the tape recorder was available Teruggi 2007 216 1950 when the machines finally functioned correctly the techniques musique concrte were expanded range new sound manipulation practices were explored using improved media manipulation methods and operations such speed variation completely new possibility organising sounds appears with tape editing which permits tape spliced and arranged with extraordinary new precision The axecut junctions were replaced with micrometric junctions and whole new technique production less dependency performance skills could developed Tape editing brought new technique called microediting which very tiny fragments sound representing milliseconds time were edited together thus creating completely new sounds structures Teruggi 2007 217 During the GRMC period from 19511958 time Schaeffer and Jacques Poullin developed number novel sound creation tools including threetrack tape recorder machine with ten playback heads replay tape loops echo the morphophone keyboardcontrolled machine replay tape loops twentyfour preset speeds the keyboard chromatic Tolana phonogne slidecontrolled machine replay tape loops continuously variable range speeds the handle continuous Sareg phonogne and device distribute encoded track across four loudspeakers including one hanging from the centre the ceiling the potentiomtre despace Palombini 1999 Speed variation was powerful tool for sound design applications had been identified that transformations brought about varying playback speed lead modification the character the sound material The phonogne was machine capable modifying sound structure significantly and provided composers with means adapt sound meet specific compositional contexts The initial phonognes were manufactured 1953 two subcontractors the chromatic phonogne company called Tolana and the sliding version the SAREG Company Poullin 1999 third version was developed later ORTF outline the unique capabilities the various phonognes can seen here This original tape recorder was one the first machines permitting the simultaneous listening several synchronised sources Until 1958 musique concrte radio and the studio machines were monophonic The threehead tape recorder superposed three magnetic tapes that were dragged common motor each tape having independent spool The objective was keep the three tapes synchronised from common starting point Works could then conceived polyphonically and thus each head conveyed part the information and was listened through dedicated loudspeaker was ancestor the multitrack player four then eight tracks that appeared the 1960s Timbres Dures Olivier Messiaen with the technical assistance Pierre Henry was the first work composed for this tape recorder 1952 rapid rhythmic polyphony was distributed over the three channels Teruggi 2007 218 This machine was conceived build complex forms through repetition and accumulation events through delays filtering and feedback consisted large rotating disk 50cm diameter which was stuck tape with its magnetic side facing outward series twelve movable magnetic heads one each recording head and erasing head and ten playback heads were positioned around the disk contact with the tape sound four seconds long could recorded the looped tape and the ten playback heads would then read the information with different delays according their adjustable positions around the disk separate amplifier and bandpass filter for each head could modify the spectrum the sound and additional feedback loops could transmit the information the recording head The resulting repetitions sound occurred different time intervals and could filtered modified through feedback This system was also easily capable producing artificial reverberation continuous sounds Teruggi 2007 218 the premiere Pierre Schaeffers Symphonie pour homme seul 1951 system that was designed for the spatial control sound was tested was called relief desk pupitre relief but also referred pupitre despace potentiomtre despace and was intended control the dynamic level music played from several shellac players This created stereophonic effect controlling the positioning monophonic sound source Teruggi 2007 218 One five tracks provided purposebuilt tape machine was controlled the performer and the other four tracks each supplied single loudspeaker This provided mixture live and preset sound positions Poullin 1957 The placement loudspeakers the performance space included two loudspeakers the front right and left the audience one placed the rear and the centre the space loudspeaker was placed high position above the audience The sounds could therefore moved around the audience rather than just across the front stage stage the control system allowed performer position sound either the left right above behind the audience simply moving small hand held transmitter coil towards away from four somewhat larger receiver coils arranged around the performer manner reflecting the loudspeaker positions Teruggi 2007 218 contemporary eyewitness described the potentiomtre despace normal use One found ones self sitting small studio which was equipped with four loudspeakerstwo front oneright and left one behind one and fourth suspended above the front center were four large loops and executant moving small magnetic unit through the air The four loops controlled the four speakers and while all four were giving off sounds all the time the distance the unit from the loops determined the volume sound sent out from eachThe music thus came one varying intensity from various parts the room and this spatial projection gave new sense the rather abstract sequence sound originally recorded Gradenwitz 1953 The central concept underlying this method was the notion that music should controlled during public presentation order create performance situation attitude that has stayed with acousmatic music the present day Teruggi 2007 218 After the longstanding rivalry with the electronic music the Cologne studio had subsided 1970 the GRM finally created electronic studio using tools developed the physicist Enrico Chiarucci called the Studio which featured the Coupigny modular synthesiser and Moog synthesiser Gayou 2007 208 The Coupigny synthesiser named for its designer Franois Coupigny director the Group for Technical Research Battier 2007 200 and the Studio mixing desk had major influence the evolution GRM and from the point their introduction they brought new quality the music Teruggi 2007 220 The mixing desk and synthesiser were combined one unit and were created specifically for the creation musique concrte The design the desk was influenced trade union rules French National Radio that required technicians and production staff have clearly defined duties The solitary practice musique concrte composition did not suit system that involved three operators one charge the machines second controlling the mixing desk and third provide guidance the others Because this the synthesiser and desk were combined and organised manner that allowed used easily composer Independently the mixing tracks twentyfour total had coupled connection patch that permitted the organisation the machines within the studio also had number remote controls for operating tape recorders The system was easily adaptable any context particularly that interfacing with external equipment Teruggi 2007 219 Before the late 1960s the musique concrte produced GRM had largely been based the recording and manipulation sounds but synthesised sounds had featured number works prior the introduction the Coupigny Pierre Henry had used oscillators produce sounds early 1955 But synthesiser with envelope control was something Pierre Schaeffer was against since favoured the preconception music and therefore deviated from Schaeffers principal making through listening Teruggi 2007 219 Because Schaeffers concerns the Coupigny synthesiser was conceived soundevent generator with parameters controlled globally without means define values precisely some other synthesisers the day Teruggi 2007 21920 The development the machine was constrained several factors needed modular and the modules had easily interconnected that the synthesiser would have more modules than slots and would have easytouse patch also needed include all the major functions modular synthesiser including oscillators noisegenerators filters ringmodulators but intermodulation facility was viewed the primary requirement enable complex synthesis processes such frequency modulation amplitude modulation and modulation via external source keyboard was attached the synthesiser and instead specific and somewhat complex envelope generator was used shape sound This synthesiser was welladapted the production continuous and complex sounds using intermodulation techniques such crosssynthesis and frequency modulation but was less effective generating precisely defined frequencies and triggering specific sounds Teruggi 2007 220 The Coupigny synthesiser also served the model for smaller portable unit which has been used down the present day Battier 2007 200 1966 composer and technician Franois Bayle was placed charge the Groupe Recherches Musicales and 1975 GRM was integrated with the new Institut national laudiovisuel INA Audiovisual National Institute with Bayle its head taking the lead work that began the early 1950s with Jacques Poullins potentiomtre despace system designed move monophonic sound sources across four speakers Bayle and the engineer JeanClaude Lallemand created orchestra loudspeakers orchestre hautparleurs known the Acousmonium 1974 Anon 2010 inaugural concert took place February 1974 the Espace Pierre Cardin Paris with presentation Bayles Exprience acoustique Gayou 2007 209 The Acousmonium specialised sound reinforcement system consisting between and 100 loudspeakers depending the character the concert varying shape and size The system was designed specifically for the concert presentation musiqueconcrtebased works but with the added enhancement sound spatialisation Loudspeakers are placed both stage and positions throughout the performance space Gayou 2007 209 and mixing console used manipulate the placement acousmatic material across the speaker array using performative technique known sound diffusion Austin 2000 1021 Bayle has commented that the purpose the Acousmonium substitute momentary classical disposition sound making which diffuses the sound from the circumference towards the centre the hall group sound projectors which form orchestration the acoustic image Bayle 1993 2010 the Acousmonium was still performing with speakers amplifiers and consoles Anon 2010
