record changed the early sixties the song the Aside was the song that the record company wanted radio stations play rpm single records 45s dominated the market terms cash sales was not until 1968 for example that the total production albums unit basis finally surpassed that singles the United Kingdom the late 1960s stereo versions pop and rock songs began regularly appear 45s The majority the 45s were played radio stations which were not equipped for stereo broadcast the time stereo was not priority However the rock stations did not like play monaural content the record companies adopted protocol for versions with the mono version the song one side and stereo version the same song the other the early 1970s doublesided hits had become rare Album sales had increased and Bsides had become the side the record where nonalbum nonradiofriendly instrumental versions simply inferior recordings were placed order further ensure that radio stations played the side that the record
