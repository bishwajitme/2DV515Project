music theory the key piece the group pitches scale that forms the basis music composition classical Western art and Western pop music The group features tonic note and its corresponding chords also called tonic tonic chord which provides subjective sense arrival and rest and also has unique relationship the other pitches the same group their corresponding chords and pitches and chords outside the group Notes and chords other than the tonic piece create varying degrees tension resolved when the tonic note chord returns The key may the major minor mode though musicians assume major statement like This piece Popular songs are usually key and classical music during the common practice period around 16501900 Longer pieces the classical repertoire may have sections contrasting keys Methods that establish the key for particular piece can complicated explain and vary over music historycitation needed However the chords most often used piece particular key are those that contain the notes the corresponding scale and conventional progressions these chords particularly cadences orient the listener around the tonic The key signature not always reliable guide the key written piece does not discriminate between major key and its relative minor the piece may modulate different key the modulation brief may not involve change key signature being indicated instead with accidentals Occasionally piece mode such Mixolydian Dorian written with major minor key signature appropriate the tonic and accidentals throughout the piece Pieces modes not corresponding major minor keys may sometimes referred being the key the tonic piece using some other type harmony resolving might described indicate that the tonal center the piece instrument key unrelated usage that means the pitches considered natural for that instrument For example modern trumpets are usually the key since the notes produced without using the valves correspond the harmonic series whose fundamental pitch Such instruments are called transposing when their written notes differ from concert pitch key relationship the relationship between keys measured common tone and nearness the circle fifths See closely related key The key usually identifies the tonic note andor chord the note andor major minor triad that represents the final point rest for piece the focal point section Though the key piece may named the title Symphony major inferred from the key signature the establishment key brought about via functional harmony sequence chords leading one more cadences andor melodic motion such movement from the leadingtone the tonic For example the key includes the following pitches and and its corresponding tonic chord GBD Most often the beginning and end traditional pieces during the common practice period the tonic sometimes with its corresponding tonic chord begins and ends piece designated key key may major minor Music can described being the Dorian mode Phrygian etc and thus usually thought specific mode rather than key Languages other than English may use other key naming systems People sometimes confuse key with scale scale ordered set notes typically used key while the key the center gravity established particular chord progressions Notes and chords within key generally come from the major minor scale associated with the tonic triad but may also include borrowed chords altered chords secondary dominants and the like All these notes and chords however are used conventional patterns that establish the primacy the tonic note and triad Cadences are particularly important the establishment key Even cadences that not include the tonic note triad such half cadences and deceptive cadences serve establish key because those chord sequences imply unique diatonic context Short pieces may stay single key throughout typical pattern for simple song might follows phrase ends with cadence the tonic second phrase ends with half cadence then final longer phrase ends with authentic cadence the tonic More elaborate pieces may establish the main key then modulate another key series keys then back the original key the Baroque was common repeat entire phrase music called ritornello each key once was established Classical sonata form the second key was typically marked with contrasting theme Another key may treated temporary tonic called tonicization common practice period compositions and most the Western popular music the 20th century pieces always begin and end the same key even some Romanticera music the key deliberately left ambiguous first Some arrangements popular songs however modulate sometime during the song often repeat the final chorus and thus end different key This example modulation should noted that the key the piece contributes indefinable something the evocative quality This very difficult put into concrete terms but slow movements Aflat major have something common fast movements minor concerto allegros major etc There has been disagreement this point has been argued since standards pitch level have changed over the centuries that today actually hear pieces written two centuries ago different usually higher key than that intended the composer has been argued that the performers concept particular key actually created factors such the feel the key tonal center the keyboard its appearance notation Many musicians however tend toward empirical acceptance specific moods associated with specific keys regardless changes pitch standards and other factors rock and popular music some pieces change back and forth modulate between two keys Examples this include Fleetwood Macs Dreams and The Rolling Stones Under Thumb This phenomenon occurs when feature that allows multiple interpretations key usually diatonic set pitch source accompanied other more precise evidence support each possible interpretation such the use one note the root the initiating harmony and persistent use another note pitch melodic resolution and root the final harmony each phrase Certain musical instruments play certain key have their music written certain key Instruments that not play the key are known transposing instruments The most common kind clarinet for example said play the key This means that scale written major sheet music actually sounds major scale when played the Bflat clarinetthat notes sound whole tone lower than written Likewise the horn normally the key sounds notes perfect fifth lower than written Similarly some instruments are built certain key For example brass instrument built plays fundamental note and can play notes the harmonic series starting without using valves fingerholes slides alter the length the vibrating column air instrument built certain key often but not always uses music written the same key see trombone for exception However some instruments such the diatonic harmonica and the harp are fact designed play only one key time accidentals are difficult impossible play The highland bagpipes are built major though the music written major with implied accidentals Western musical composition the key piece has important ramifications for its composition Key coloration the difference between the intervals different keys single nonequal tempered tuning and the overall sound and feel the key created the tuning its intervals Historical irregular musical temperaments usually have the narrowest fifths between the diatonic notes naturals producing purer thirds and wider fifths among the chromatic notes sharps and flats Each key then has slightly different intonation hence different keys have distinct characters Such key coloration was essential part much eighteenth and nineteenthcentury music and was described treatises the period For example tunings with wolf fifth the key the lowest note the fifth sounds dramatically different from other keys and often avoided Pythagorean tuning the major triad just while the major triad noticeably out tune 418 due 52144 cents being Pythagorean comma 2346 cents larger sharp compared Modern music lacks key coloration because uses equal temperament which all keys have the same pattern intonation differing only pitch
