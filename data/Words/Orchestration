Orchestration the study practice writing music for orchestra more loosely for any musical ensemble such concert band adapting music composed for another medium for orchestra Also called instrumentation orchestration the selection different instruments play the different parts melody bassline etc musical work For example work for solo piano could adapted and orchestrated that orchestra could perform the piece concert band piece could orchestrated for symphony orchestra Only gradually over the course music history did orchestration come regarded separate compositional art and profession itself classical music most composers write the melodies chord progression and musical form for piece and then they want the piece played orchestra they orchestrate the piece themselves musical theatre however the composer typically writes the melodies and then hires professional arranger orchestrator devise the parts for the pit orchestra play Similarly when film company making film score composer thinks the main melodies and themes for the score and then one more orchestrators are hired flesh out these basic melodies adding accompaniment parts basslines backing chords and jazz big bands the composer songwriter writes the lead sheet which contains the melody and the chords and then one more orchestrators arrangers flesh out these basic musical ideas creating parts for the saxophones trumpets trombones and the rhythm section bass pianojazz guitarHammond organ drums orchestrator trained musical professional who assigns instruments from orchestra other musical ensemble piece music written composer who adapts music composed for another medium for orchestra Orchestrators may work for musical theatre productions film production companies recording studios Some orchestrators teach colleges conservatories universities The training done orchestrators varies Most have completed formal postsecondary education music such Bachelor Music BMus Master Music MMus artists diploma Orchestrators who teach universities colleges and conservatories may required hold masters degree Doctorate the latter may PhD DMA Orchestrators who work for film companies musical theatre companies and other organizations may hired solely based their orchestration experience even they not hold academic credentials the 2010s the percentage faculty holding terminal degrees andor Doctoral degrees part how institution rated this causing increasing number postsecondary institutions require terminal andor Doctoral degrees The term orchestration its specific sense refers the way instruments are used portray any musical aspect such melody harmony rhythm For example major chord made the notes and the notes are held out the entire duration measure the composer orchestrator will have decide what instruments play this chord and what register Some instruments including woodwinds and brass are monophonic and can only play one note the chord time However full orchestra there are more than one these instruments the composer may choose outline the chord its basic form with group clarinets trumpets with separate instruments each being given one the three notes the chord Other instruments including the strings piano harp and pitched percussion are polyphonic and may play more than one note time such the composerorchestrator wishes have the strings play the major chord she could assign the low the cellos and basses the the violas and then high the second violins and octave higher the first violins the composerorchestrator wishes the chord played only the first and second violins she could give the second violins low and give the first violins double stop the notes open string and Additionally orchestration notes may placed into another register such transposed down for the basses doubled both the same and different octaves and altered with various levels dynamics The choice instruments registers and dynamics affect the overall tone color the major chord was orchestrated for the trumpets and trombones playing fortissimo their upper registers would sound very bright but the same chord was orchestrated for the celli and string basses playing sul tasto doubled the bassoons and bass clarinet might sound heavy and dark Note that although the above example discussed orchestrating chord melody even single note may orchestrated this fashion Also note that this specific sense the word orchestration not necessarily limited orchestra composer may orchestrate this same major chord for say woodwind quintet string quartet concert band Each different ensemble would enable the orchestratorcomposer create different tone colours and timbres melody also orchestrated The composer orchestrator may think melody her head while playing the piano organ Once she has thought melody she has decide which instrument instruments will play the melody One widely used approach for melody assign the first violins When the first violins play melody the composer can have the second violins double the melody octave below have the second violins play harmony part often thirds and sixths Sometimes for forceful effect composer will indicate the score that all the strings violins violas cellos and double basses will play the melody unison the same time Typically even though the instruments are playing the same note names the violins will play very highregister notes the violas and cellos will play lowerregister notes and the double basses will play the deepest lowest pitches well the woodwinds and brass instruments can effectively carry melody depending the effect the composerorchestrator desires The trumpets can perform melody powerful high register Alternatively the trombones play melody the pitch will lower than the trumpet and the tone will heavier which may change the musical effect that created While the cellos are often given accompaniment role orchestration there are notable cases where the cellos have been assigned the melody even more rare cases the double bass section principal bass may given melody the highregister double bass solo Prokofievs Lieutenant Kije Suite While assigning melody particular section such the string section the woodwinds will work well the stringed instruments and all the woodwinds blend together well some composers give the melody one section and then have the melody doubled different section instrument from different section For example melody played the first violins could doubled the glockenspiel which would add sparkling chimelike colour the melody Alternatively melody played the piccolos could doubled the celesta which would add bright tone the sound the 20th and 21st century contemporary composers began incorporate electric and electronic instruments into the orchestra such the electric guitar played through guitar amplifier the electric bass played through bass amplifier the Theremin and the synthesizer The addition these new instruments gave composers new options for creating tonal colours their orchestration For example the late 20th century and onwards composer could have melody played the first violins doubled futuristicsounding synthesizer theremin create unusual effect

orchestral accompaniment the aria misericordia from JSBachs Magnificat BWV243 1723 features muted strings doubled flutes subtle combination mellow instrumental timbres The orchestral introduction the opening chorus JSBachs epiphany Cantata Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen BWV65 which John Eliot Gardiner 2013 p328 describes one the crowning glories Bachs first Christmas season demonstrates the composers mastery his craft Within space eight bars hear recorders oboes caccia horns and strings creating glittery sheen contrasted timbres sonorities and textures ranging from just two horns against string pedal point the first bar restatement the octave unison theme this time all the voices and instruments spread over five octaves bars Igor Stravinsky 1959 p45 marvelled Bachs skill orchestrator What incomparable instrumental writing Bachs You can smell the resin rosin his violin parts and taste the reeds the oboes Jean Philippe Rameau was famous for the eloquence his orchestral writing which was something entirely new with feeling for colour tone colour timbre that altogether modern The Entrance Polymnie from his opera Les Borades 1763 the predominant string texture shot through with descending scale figures the bassoon creating exquisite blend timbres Another important technique orchestration was antiphony the call and response exchange musical motifs ideas between different groups the orchestra antiphonal section the composer may have one group instruments introduce melodic idea the first violins and then have the woodwinds answer restating this melodic idea often with some type variation the trio section the minuet from Mozarts Symphony 1788 the flute bassoons and horn exchange phrases with the strings with the first violin line doubled the octave the first oboe Charles Rosen 1971 p240 admires Mozarts skill orchestrating his piano concertos particularly the Concerto flat major K482 work that introduced clarinets into the mix This concerto places the greatest musical reliance tone colour which indeed almost always ravishing One lovely example its sonorities comes near the beginning The orchestral tutti the first two bars answered just horns and bassoon bars This passage repeats with fresh orchestration Here have the unusual sound the violins providing the bass for the solo clarinets The simplicity the sequence concentrates all our interest tonecolour and what follows series woodwind solos keeps there The orchestration throughout fact has greater variety than Mozart had wished needed before and fits the brilliance charm and grace the first movement and the finale demonstration Beethovens consummate skill obtaining the maximum variety out seemingly unprepossessing and fairly simple material can found the first movement the Piano Concerto flat The Emperor Opus 1810 The second subject the sonata form deceptively simple tune that according Fiske 1970 p41 limited notes playable the horns for which music have been specially designed This theme appears five different orchestrations throughout the movement with changes mode major minor dynamics forte pianissimo and blending instrumental colour that ranges from boldly stated tutti passages the most subtle and differentiated episodes where instrumental sounds are combined often quite unexpected ways The theme first appears the minor mode during the orchestral introduction performed using staccato articulation and orchestrated the most delicate and enchanting colours This followed more straightforward version the major key with horns accompanied strings The theme now played legato the horns accompanied sustained pedal point the bassoons The violins simultaneously play elaborated version the theme See also heterophony The timpani and pizzicato lower strings add further colour this variegated palette sounds Considering that the notes are virtually the same the difference effect extraordinary When the solo piano enters its right hand plays variant the minor version the theme triplet rhythm with the backing pizzicato plucked strings the offbeats This followed bold tutti statement the theme with the whole orchestra thumping out aggressive semistaccato The minor version the theme also appears the cadenza played staccato the solo piano This followed finally restatement the major key version featuring horns playing legato accompanied pizzicato strings and filigree arpeggio figuration the solo piano Fiske 1970 says that Beethoven shows superb flood invention through these varied treatments The variety moods this theme can convey without limit The most significant orchestral innovator the early 19th century was Hector Berlioz The composer was also the author Treatise Instrumentation was drawn the orchestra his chosen medium instinct and finding out the exact capabilities and timbres individual instruments and was this raw material that his imagination worked produce countless new sonorities very striking when considered totality crucially instructive for later composers and nearly all exactly tailored their dramatic expressive purpose Numerous examples Berliozs orchestral wizardry and his penchant for conjuring extraordinary sonorities can found his Symphonie fantastique The opening the fourth movement entitled March the Scaffold features what for the time 1830 must have seemed bizarre mix sounds The timpani and the double basses play thick chords against the snarling muted brass Although derives from Beethoven Berlioz uses features that run counter the rules composition general such the chords close position the low register the double basses Berlioz was also capable conveying great delicacy his instrumental writing particularly spectacular instance the Queen Mab scherzo from the Romeo Juliette symphony which Hugh Macdonald 1969 p51 describes Berliozs supreme exercise light orchestral texture brilliant gossamer fabric prestissimo and pianissimo almost without pause Boulez points out that the very fast tempo must have made unprecedented demands conductors and orchestras the time 1830 Because the rapid and precise rhythms the staccatos which must even and regular all registers because the isolated notes that occur right the end the bar the third quaverall which must fall into place with absolutely perfect precision Macdonald highlights the passage towards the end the scherzo where The sounds become more ethereal and fairylike low clarinet high harps and the belllike antique cymbalsThe pace and fascination the movement are irresistible some the most ethereally brilliant music ever penned The New Grove Dictionary says that for Berlioz orchestration was intrinsic composition not something applied finished musicin his hands timbre became something that could used free combinations artist might use his palette without bowing the demands line and this leads the rich orchestral resource Debussy and Ravel After Berlioz Richard Wagner was the major pioneer the development orchestration during the 19th century Pierre Boulez speaks the sheer richness Wagners orchestration and his irrepressible instinct for innovation Peter Latham says that Wagner had unique appreciation the possibilities for colour inherent the instruments his disposal and was this that guided him both his selection new recruits for the orchestral family and his treatment its established members The wellknown division that family into strings woodwind and brass with percussion required inherited from the great classical symphonists such changes made were the direction splitting these groups still further Latham gives example the sonority the opening the opera Lohengrin where the ethereal quality the music due the violins being divided into four five even eight parts instead the customary two matured composer particularly through his experience composing The Ring Wagner made increasing use the contrast between pure and mixed colours bringing fine point the art transition from one field sonority another Robert Craft found Wagners final opera Parsifal work where Wagners powers are their pinnacle The orchestral blends and separations are without precedent Craft cites the intricate orchestration the single line melody that opens the opera Parsifal makes entirely new uses orchestral colour Without the help the score even very sensitive ear cannot distinguish the instruments playing the unison beginning the Prelude The violins are halved then doubled the cellos clarinet and bassoon well for the peak the phrase alto oboe cor anglais The full novelty this colour change with the oboe both intensity and timbre can appreciated only after the theme repeated harmony and one the most gorgeous orchestrations even Wagners Technicolor imagination Later during the opening scene the first act Parsifal Wagner offsets the bold brass with gentler strings showing that the same musical material feels very different when passed between contrasting families instruments the other hand the prelude the opera Tristan and Isolde exemplifies the variety that Wagner could extract through combining instruments from different orchestral families with his precise markings dynamics and articulation the opening phrase the cellos are supported wind instruments When this idea returns towards the end the prelude the instrumental colors are varied subtly with sounds that were new the 19th century orchestra such the cor anglais and the bass clarinet These together with the ominous rumbling the timpani effectively convey the brooding atmosphere Its impressive see how Wagner produces balance his works true genius this respect undeniably even down the working out the exact number instruments Boulez fascinated the precision with which Wagner gauges orchestral balance which contains multiplicity details that achieved with astonishing precision According Roger Scruton Seldom since Bachs inspired use obbligato parts his cantatas have the instruments the orchestra been meticulously and lovingly adapted their expressive role Wagner his later operas William Austin 1966 says Mahler expanded the orchestra going ahead historic climax the direction already marked Beethoven Berlioz and Wagner The purpose this famous expansion was not sheer increase volume but greater variety sound with more nearly continuous gradations Mahler only occasionally required all his vast orchestra play together and his music was often soft loud Its colours were continually shifting blending contrasting with each other Adorno 1971 similarly describes Mahlers symphonic writing characterised massive tutti effects contrasted with chambermusic procedures The following passage from the first movement his Symphony illustrates this Only the first bar the above there full ensemble The remaining bars feature highly differentiated small groups instruments Mahlers experienced conductors ear led him write detailed performance markings his scores including carefully calibrated dynamics For example bar above the low harp note marked forte the clarinets mezzoforte and the horns piano Austin 1966 says that Mahler cared about the finest nuances loudness and tempo and worked tirelessly fix these details his scoresMahlers imagination for sonority exemplified the closing bars the slow movement the Fourth Symphony where there occurs what Walter Piston 1969 p140 describes instance inspired orchestration noted are the sudden change mode the harmonic progression the unusual spacing the chord measure and the placing the perfect fourth the two flutes The effect quite unexpected and magical Apart from Mahler and Richard Strauss the major innovator orchestration during the closing years the nineteenth and the first decades the twentieth century was Claude Debussy According Pierre Boulez 1975 p20 Debussys orchestration when compared with even such brilliant contemporaries Strauss and Mahler shows infinitely fresher imagination Boulez said that Debussys orchestration was conceived from quite different point view the number instruments their balance the order which they are used their use itself produces different climate Apart from the early impact Wagner Debussy was also fascinated music from Asia that according Austin heard repeatedly and admired intensely the Paris World exhibition 1889 Both influences inform Debussys first major orchestral work Prelude laprsmidi dun faune 1894 Wagners influence can heard the strategic use silence the sensitively differentiated orchestration and above all the striking halfdiminished seventh chord spread between oboes and clarinets reinforced glissando the harp Austin 1966 p16 continues Only composer thoroughly familiar with the Tristan chord could have conceived the beginning the Faune Later the Faune Debussy builds complex texture where Austin says Polyphony and orchestration overlapHe adds all the devices Mozart Weber Berlioz and Wagner the possibilities that learned from the heterophonic music the Far East The first harp varies the flute parts almost the same way that the smallest bells Javanese gamelan vary the slower basic melody Debussys final orchestral work the enigmatic ballet Jeux 1913 was composed nearly years after the Faune The opening bars feature divided strings spread over wide range harp doubling horns with the addition the belllike celesta the 5th bar and the sultry voicing the whole tone chords the woodwind Jensen 2014 p228 says Perhaps the greatest marvel Jeux its orchestration While working the piano score Debussy wrote thinking that orchestral colour which seems illuminated from behind and for which there are such marvellous displays Parsifal The idea then was produce timbre without glare subdued but with clarity and precision more general sense orchestration also refers the readaptation existing music into another medium particularly full reduced orchestra There are two general kinds adaptation transcription which closely follows the original piece and arrangement which tends change significant aspects the original piece terms adaptation orchestration applies strictly speaking only writing for orchestra whereas the term instrumentation applies instruments used the texture the piece the study orchestration contradistinction the practice the term instrumentation may also refer consideration the defining characteristics individual instruments rather than the art combining instruments commercial music especially musical theatre and film music independent orchestrators are often used because difficult meet tight deadlines when the same person required both compose and orchestrate Frequently when stage musical adapted film such Camelot Fiddler the Roof the orchestrations for the film version are notably different from the stage ones other cases such Evita they are not and are simply expanded versions from those used the stage production Most orchestrators often work from draft sketch short score that score written limited number independent musical staves Some orchestrators particularly those writing for the opera music theatres prefer work from piano vocal score since the singers need start rehearsing piece long before the whole work fully completed That was for instance the method composition Jules Massenet other instances simple cooperation between various creators utilized when Jonathan Tunick orchestrates Stephen Sondheims songs when orchestration done from lead sheet simplified music notation for song which includes just the melody and the chord progression the latter case arranging well orchestration will involved Due the enormous time constraints film scoring schedules most film composers employ orchestrators rather than doing the work themselves although these orchestrators work under the close supervision the composer Some film composers have made the time orchestrate their own music including Bernard Herrmann 19111975 Georges Delerue 19251992 Ennio Morricone 1928 John Williams 1932 his very detailed sketches are orchestrated Howard Shore 1946 James Horner 19532015 Braveheart Bruno Coulais 1954 Rachel Portman 1960 Philippe Rombi 1968 and Abel Korzeniowski 1972 Although there have been hundreds orchestrators film over the years the most prominent film orchestrators for the latter half the 20th century were Jack Hayes Herbert Spencer Edward Powell who worked almost exclusively with Alfred Newman Arthur Morton Greig McRitchie and Alexander Courage Some the most indemand orchestrators today and the past years include Jeff Atmajian Pete Anthony Brad Dechter James Newton Howard Christopher Young Theodore Shapiro Teddy Castellucci Danny Elfman John Powell Marco Beltrami John Debney Marc Shaiman Michael Giacchino Conrad Pope John Williams Alexandre Desplat Jerry Goldsmith James Newton Howard Alan Silvestri James Horner Mark Isham John Powell Michael Convertino Danny Elfman Howard Shore Eddie Karam John Williams James Horner Bruce Fowler Hans Zimmer Klaus Badelt Harry GregsonWilliams Steve

Elliot Goldenthal Michael Kamen Shearmur Brian Tyler Klaus Badelt Ilan Eshkeri and JAC Redford James Horner Thomas Newman Conrad Salinger was the most prominent orchestrator MGM musicals from the 1940s 1962 orchestrating such famous films Singin the Rain American Paris and Gigi the 1950s film composer John Williams frequently spent time with Salinger informally learning the craft orchestration Robert Russell Bennett George Gershwin Rodgers and Hammerstein was one Americas most prolific orchestrators particularly Broadway shows the 20th century sometimes scoring over pages day Most films require 120 minutes musical score Each individual piece music film called cue There are roughly 2080 cues per film dramatic film may require slow and sparse music while action film may require cues highly active music Each cue can range length from five seconds more than ten minutes needed per scene the film After the composer finished composing the cue this sketch score delivered the orchestrator either hand written computer generated Most composers Hollywood today compose their music using sequencing software Digital Performer Logic Pro Cubase sketch score can generated through the use MIDI file which then imported into music notation program such Finale Sibelius Thus begins the job the orchestrator Every composer works differently and the orchestrators job understand what required from one composer the next the music created with sequencing software then the orchestrator given MIDI sketch score and synthesized recording the cue The sketch score only contains the musical notes eighth notes quarter notes etc with phrasing articulations dynamics The orchestrator studies this synthesized mockup recording listening dynamics and phrasing just the composer has played them she then accurately tries represent these elements the orchestra However some voicings synthesizer synthestration will not work the same way when orchestrated for the live orchestra The sound samples are often doubled very prominently and thickly with other sounds order get the music speak louder The orchestrator sometimes changes these synth voicings traditional orchestral voicings order make the music flow better she may move intervals down the octave omit them entirely double certain passages with other instruments the orchestra add percussion instruments provide colour and add Italian performance marks Allegro con brio Adagio ritardando dolce staccato etc composer writes large action cue and woodwinds are used the orchestrator will often add woodwinds doubling the brass music octave The orchestra size determined from the music budget the film The orchestrator told advance the number instruments she has work with and has abide what available bigbudget film may able afford Romantic music eraorchestra with over 100 musicians contrast lowbudget independent film may only able afford performer chamber orchestra jazz quartet Sometimes composer will write threepart chord for three flutes although only two flutes have been hired The orchestrator decides where put the third note For example the orchestrator could have the clarinet woodwind that blends well with flute play the third note After the orchestrated cue complete delivered the copying house generally placing computer server that each instrument the orchestra can electronically extracted printed and delivered the scoring stage The major film composers Hollywood each have lead orchestrator Generally the lead orchestrator attempts orchestrate much the music possible time allows the schedule too demanding team orchestrators ranging from two eight will work film The lead orchestrator decides the assignment cues other orchestrators the team Most films can orchestrated one two weeks with team five orchestrators New orchestrators trying obtain work will often approach film composer asking hired They are generally referred the lead orchestrator for consideration the scoring stage the orchestrator will often assist the composer the recording booth giving suggestions how improve the performance the music the recording the composer conducting sometimes the orchestrator will remain the recording booth assist producer Sometimes the roles are reversed with the orchestrator conducting and the composer producing from the booth
