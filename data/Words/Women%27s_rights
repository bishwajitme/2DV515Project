Christian Church one the first formal legal provision for the right wives was promulgated council Adge 506 which Canon XVI stipulated that young married man wished ordained required the consent his wife The English Church and culture the Middle Ages regarded women weak irrational and vulnerable temptation who was constantly needed kept checkbettersourceneeded This was reflected the Christian culture England through the story Adam and Eve where Eve fell Satans temptations and led Adam eat the apple was belief based StPaul that the pain childbirth was punishment for this deed that led mankind banished from the Garden Eden Womens inferiority also appears many medieval writing for example the 1200 theologian Jacques Vitry who was rather sympathetic women over others emphasized for female obedience towards their men and expressed women being slippery weak untrustworthy devious deceitful and stubborn The church also promoted the Virgin Mary role model for women emulate being innocent her sexuality being married husband and eventually becoming mother That was the core purpose set out both culturally and religiously across Medieval Europe Rape was also seen medieval England

husband without her familys consent but neither could the wife This mean woman could not transfer her property her husband without her family kinsmans consent either Swedish law women would also only get half that her brother inheritance Despite these legal issues Sweden was largely ahead and much superior their treatment towards women than most European countries Medieval marriages among the elites were arranged way that would meet the interests the family whole Theoretically woman needed consent before marriage took place and the Church encouraged this consent expressed present tense and not future Marriage could also take place anywhere and minimum age for girls would have while for boys The rate Wergild suggested that women these societies were valued mostly for their breeding

different laws depending the local county law signifying that the status women could vary depending which county she was living The 16th and 17th century saw numerous witch trials which resulted thousands people across Europe being executed whom 7595 were women depending time and place The executions mostly took place Germanspeaking lands and during the 15th century the terminology witchcraft was definitely viewed something feminine opposed prior years Famous witchcraft manuals such the Malleus Maleficarum and Summis Desiderantes depicted witches diabolical conspirators who worshipped Satan and were primarily women Culture and art the time depicted these witches seductive and evil further fuelling moral panic fusion with rhetoric from the Church The origin the female witch myth traces back Roman mythical night creatures known Strix who were thought appear and disappear mysteriously the night They were also believed many transformed women their own supernatural powers This Roman myth itself believed originate from the Jewish Sabbath which described nonsupernatural women who would suspiciously leave and return home swiftly during the night Authors the Malleus Maleficarum strongly established the link between witchcraft and women proclaiming greater likelihood for women addicted evil The authors and inquisitors Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprengerh justified these beliefs claiming women had greater credulity impressionability feeble minds feeble bodies impulsivity and carnal natures which were flaws susceptible evil behavior and witchcraft These sort beliefs

the right their property once they married Under the common law doctrine coverture husbands gained control their wives real estate and wages Beginning the 1840s state legislatures the United States and the British Parliament began passing statutes that protected womens property from their husbands and their husbands creditors These laws were known the Married Womens Property Acts Courts the 19thcentury United States also continued require privy examinations married women who sold their property privy examination was practice which married woman who wished sell her property had separately examined judge justice the peace outside the presence her husband and asked her husband was pressuring her into signing the document Property rights for women continued restricted many European countries until legal reforms the 196070s For example West Germany the law pertaining rural farm succession favored male heirs until 1963 the Head and master laws which gave sole control marital property the husband were common until few decades ago The Supreme Court Kirchberg Feenstra 1981 declared such laws unconstitutional Freedom movement essential right recognized international instruments including Article CEDAW Nevertheless many regions the world women have this right severely restricted law practice For instance some countries women may not leave the home without male guardian without the consent the husband for example the personal law Yemen states that wife must obey her husband and must not get out the home without his consent Even countries which not have legal restrictions womens movement may prevented practice social and religious norms such purdah Laws restricting women from travelling existed until relatively recently some Western countries until 1983 Australia the passport application married woman had authorized her husband Various practices have been used historically restrict womens freedom movement such foot binding the custom applying painfully tight binding the feet young Chinese girls which was common between the 10th and 20th century Womens freedom movement may restricted laws but may also restricted attitudes towards women public spaces areas where not socially accepted for women leave the home women who are outside may face abuse such insults sexual harassment and violenceMany the restrictions womens freedom movement are framed measures protect women For example the summer 2017 India women named Varnika Kundu shared story Facebook about being stalked two men late night Kundu was coming home after night out with friends when two men began following her Kundu made home unharmed but was understandably shaken after the incident She posted her story Facebook hoping bring awareness and warn other women but was instead met with backlash trolls telling her she shouldnt have been out that late and that was her fault for being that situation This incident spawned the AintNoCinderella movement where women all over the world shared pictures them being out past midnight with the hashtag order combat gender stereotypes and bias The lack legal knowledge among many women especially developing countries major obstacle the improvement womens situation International bodies such the United Nations have stated that the obligation states does not only consist passing relevant laws but also informing women about the existence such laws order enable them seek justice and realize practice their rights Therefore states must popularize the laws and explain them clearly the public order prevent ignorance misconceptions originating popular myths about the laws The United Nations Development Programme states that order advance gender justice Women must know their rights and able access legal systems and the 1993 Declaration the Elimination Violence Against Women states Art States should also inform women their rights seeking redress through such mechanisms Womens rights movements focus ending discrimination women this regard the definition discrimination itself important According the jurisprudence the ECHR the right freedom from discrimination includes not only the obligation states treat the same way persons who are analogous situations but also the obligation treat different way persons who are different situations this regard equity not just equality important Therefore states must sometimes differentiate between women and men through for example offering maternity leave other legal protections surrounding pregnancy and childbirth take into account the biological realities reproduction through acknowledging specific historical context For example acts violence committed men against women not happen vacuum but are part social context Opuz Turkey the ECHR defined violence against women form discrimination against women this also the position the Istanbul Convention which Article states that violence against women understood violation human rights and form discrimination against women There are different views where appropriate differentiate between women and men and one view that the act sexual intercourse act where this difference must acknowledged both due the increased physical risks for the woman and due the historical context women being systematically subjected forced sexual intercourse while socially subordinated position particularly within marriage and during war States must also differentiate with regard healthcare ensuring that womens health particularly with regard reproductive health such pregnancy and childbirth not neglected According the World Health Organization Discrimination health care settings takes many forms and often manifested when individual group denied access health care services that are otherwise available others can also occur through denial services that are only needed certain groups such women The refusal states acknowledge the specific needs women such the necessity specific policies like the strong investment states reducing maternal mortality can form discrimination this regard treating women and men similarly does not work because certain biological aspects such menstruation pregnancy labor childbirth breastfeeding well certain medical conditions only affect women The Committee the Elimination Discrimination against Women stipulates its General recommendation gender based violence against women updating general recommendation that states should Examine gender neutral laws and policies ensure that they not create perpetuate existing inequalities and repeal modify them they paragraph Another example gender neutral policy which harms women that where medication tested medical trials only men also used women assuming that there are biological differences Health defined the World Health Organization state complete physical mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence disease infirmity Womens health refers the health women which differs from that men many unique ways Womens health severely impaired some parts the world due factors such inequality confinement women the home indifference medical workers lack autonomy women lack financial resources women Discrimination against women occurs also through denial medical services that are only needed women Violations womens right health may result maternal death accounting for more than 300000 deaths per year most them developing countries Certain traditional practices such female genital mutilation also affect womens health Worldwide young women and adolescent girls are the population most
