The harp stringed musical instrument that has number individual strings running angle its soundboard the strings are plucked with the fingers Harps have been known since antiquity Asia Africa and Europe dating back least early 3500BC The instrument had great popularity Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance where evolved into wide range variants with new technologies and was disseminated Europes colonies finding particular popularity Latin America Although some ancient members the harp family died out the Near East and South Asia descendants early harps are still played Myanmar and parts Africa and other defunct variants Europe and Asia have been utilized musicians the modern era Harps vary globally many ways terms size many smaller harps can played the lap whereas larger harps are quite heavy and rest the floor Different harps may use strings catgut nylon metal some combination While all harps have neck resonator and strings frame harps have pillar their long end support the strings while open harps such arch harps and bow harps not Modern harps also vary techniques used extend the range and chromaticism adding sharps and flats the strings such adjusting strings note midperformance with levers pedals which modify the pitch The pedal harp standard instrument the orchestra the Romantic music era 18001910 and the contemporary music era The earliest harps and lyres were found Sumer 3500BC and several harps were found burial pits and royal tombs The oldest depictions harps without forepillar can seen adjacent the Near East the wall paintings ancient Egyptian tombs the Nile Valley which date from early 3000BC These murals show instrument that closely resembles the hunters bow without the pillar that find modern harpsThe chang flourished Persia many forms from its introduction about 4000BC until the 17th century Around 1900BC arched harps the IraqIran region were replaced angular harps with vertical horizontal sound boxes the start the Common Era robust vertical angular harps which had become predominant the Hellenistic world were cherished the Sasanian court the last century the Sasanian period angular harps were redesigned make them light possible light vertical angular harps while they became more elegant they lost their structural rigidity the height the Persian tradition illustrated book production AD13001600 such light harps were still frequently depicted although their use musical instruments was reaching its end The works the Tamil Sangam literature describe the harp and its variants early 200BC Variants were described ranging from strings and the instrument used wandering minstrels for accompaniment Iconographic evidence the yaal appears temple statues dated early 500BCcitation needed One the Sangam works the Kallaadam recounts how the first yaa harp was inspired archers bow when heard the musical sound its twangcitation needed Another early South Asian harp was the ancient veena unlike the modern instrument the same name the ancient veena was harp vice the modern lutetype instrument Some Samudragupta gold coins show the mid4th century show presumably the king Samudragupta himself playing the instrument The ancient veena survives today Burma the form the saung harp still played there The harp was popular ancient China and neighboring regions though harps are largely extinct East Asia the modern day The Chinese konghou harp documented early the Spring and Autumn period 770476BC and became extinct during the Ming Dynasty AD13681644 similar harp the gonghu was played ancient Korea documented early the Goguryeo period 37BC AD686 Harps are essentially triangular and made primarily wood Strings are made gut wire often replaced the modern day nylon metal The top end each string secured the crossbar neck where each will have tuning peg similar device adjust the pitch From the crossbar the string runs down the sounding board the resonating body where secured with knot modern harps the strings hole protected with eyelet limit wear the wood the distance between the tuning peg and the soundboard well tension and weight the string which decide the pitch the string The body hollow and when taut string plucked the body resonates projecting sound The longest side the harp called the column pillar though some earlier harps such bow harp lack pillar most harps the sole purpose the pillar hold the neck against the great strain the strings harps which have pedals largely the modern concert harp the pillar hollow column and encloses the rods which adjust the pitches which are levered pressing pedals the base the instrument harps earlier design given string can play only single note without retuning many cases this means such harp can only play one key time and must manually retuned play another key Various remedies this limitation evolved the addition extra strings cover chromatic notes sometimes separate angled rows distinct from the main row strings addition small levers the crossbar which when actuated raise the pitch string set interval usually semitone use pedals the base the instrument which change the pitch string when pressed with the foot These solutions increase the versatility harp the cost adding complexity weight and expense While the angle and bow harps held popularity elsewhere European harps favored the pillar third structural member support the far ends the arch and soundbox harp with triangular threepart frame depicted 8thcentury Pictish stones Scotland and manuscripts the Utrecht Psalter from early 9thcentury France The curve the harps neck result the proportional shortening the basic triangular form keep the strings equidistant the strings were proportionately distant they would farther apart European harps evolved play more complex music key consideration was some way facilitate the quick changing strings pitch able play more chromatic notes the Baroque period Italy and Spain more strings were added allow for chromatic notes more complex harps Germany the second half the 17th century diatonic singlerow harps were fitted with manually turned hooks which fretted individual strings raise their pitch half step the 18th century link mechanism was developed connecting these hooks with pedals leading the invention the singleaction pedal harp The first primitive form pedal harps was developed the Tyrol region Austria Jacob Hochbrucker was the next design improved pedal mechanism around 1720 followed succession Krumpholtz Nadermann and the Erard company who came with the double mechanism which second row hooks was installed along the neck capable raising the pitch string either one two half steps While one course European harps led greater complexity resulting largely the modern pedal harp other harping traditions maintained simpler diatonic instruments which survived and evolved into modern traditions the Americas harps are widely but sparsely distributed except certain regions where the harp traditions are very strong Such important centres include Mexico the Andean region Venezuela and Paraguay They are derived from the Baroque harps that were brought from Spain during the colonial period Detailed features vary from place place The Paraguayan harp that countrys national instrument and has gained worldwide reputation with international influences alongside folk traditions Paraguayan harps have around 36strings played with the fingernails and with narrowing spacing and lower tension than modern Western harps and have wide and deep soundbox which tapers the top The harp also found Argentina though Uruguay was largely displaced religious music the organ the end the 18thcentury The harp historically found Brazil but mostly the south the country The Andean harp Quechua arpa also known Peruan harp indigenous harp widespread among peoples living highlands the Andes Quechua and Aymara mainly Peru and also Bolivia and Ecuador Andean harp has relatively large size Its distinguishing feature significantly increased volume the resonator box which gives basses special richness Andean harp usually accompanies love dances and songs such huayno One the most famous performers the Andean harp was Juan Cayambe Pimampiro Canton Imbabura Province Ecuador Mexican jarocha harp music Veracruz has also gained some international recognition evident the popularity

modern Venezuelan arpa llanera has 32strings nylon originally gut The arpa central strung with wire the higher register number types harps are found Africa predominantly not the threesided frameharp type found Europe number these referred generically African harps are bow angle harps which lack forepillars joining the neck the body number harplike instruments Africa are not easily classified with European categories Instruments like the West African kora and Mauritanian ardin are sometimes labeled spike harp bridge harp harp lute since their construction includes bridge which holds the strings laterally vice vertically entering the soundboard While lyres and zithers have persisted the Middle East most the true harps the region have become extinct though some are undergoing initial revivals The Turkish eng was ninestring harp the Ottoman Empire which became extinct the end the 17th century but has undergone some revival and evolution since the late 20th century similar harp the changi

the Padhar people Madhya Pradesh The harp largely became extinct East Asia the 17th century around the year 1000 harps like the vajra began replace precedingclarification needed harps few examples survived the modern era particularly Myanmars saunggauk which considered the national instrument that country Though the ancient Chinese konghou has not been directly resurrected the name has been revived and applied modern newly invented instrument based the Western classical harp but with the strings doubled back form two notes per string allowing advanced techniques such notebendingcitation needed The concert harp technologically advanced instrument particularly distinguished its use pedals footcontrolled devices which can alter the pitch given strings making fully chromatic and thus able play wide body classical repertoire The pedal harp contains seven pedals that each affect the tuning all strings one pitchclass The pedals from left right are the left side and the right Pedals were first introduced 1697 Jakob Hochbrucker Bavaria 1811 these were upgraded the double action pedal system patented Sbastien Erard The addition pedals broadened the harps abilities allowing its gradual entry into the classical orchestra largely beginning the 19th century The harp played little role early classical music being used only handful times major composers such Mozart and Beethoven and its usage Cesar Franck his Symphony minor 1888 was described revolutionary despite some body prior classical usage Entering the 20th century the pedal harp found use outside classical music entering jazz with Casper Reardonwhen the Beatles 1967 single Shes Leaving Home and several works Bjrk which featured harpist Zeena Parkins the modern era there family midsize harps generally with nylon strings and optionally with partial full levers but without pedals They range from two six octaves and are plucked with the fingers using similar technique the pedal harp Though these harps evoke ties historical European harps their specifics are modern and they are frequently referred broadly Celtic harps due their region revival and popular association more generically folk harps due their use nonclassical music lever harps contrast their modifying mechanism with the larger pedal harp The modern Celtic harp began appear the early 19thcentury Ireland contemporary with the dyingout earlier forms Gaelic harp Dublin pedal harp maker John Egan developed new type harp which had gut strings and semitone mechanisms like orchestral pedal harp was small and curved like the historical clirseach Irish harp but its strings were gut and the soundbox was much lighter the 1890s similar new harp was also developed Scotland part Gaelic cultural revival the mid20thcentury Jord Cochevelou developed variant the modern Celtic harp which referred the Breton Celtic harp his son Alan Stivell was become the most influential Breton harper and strong influence the broader world the Celtic harp multicourse harp harp with more than one row strings opposed the more common single course harp doubleharp the two rows generally run parallel each other one either side the neck and are usually both diatonic sometimes with levers with identical notes The triple harp originated Italy the 16th century and arrived Wales the late 17th century where established itself the local tradition the Welsh harp telyn deires threerow harp The triple consists two outer rows identical diatonic strings with third set chromatic strings between them These strings are off set permit the harpist reach past the outer row and pluck inner string chromatic note needed Some harps rather than using pedal lever devices achieve chromaticity simply adding additional strings cover the notes outside their diatonic home scale The Welsh triple harp one such instrument and two other instruments employing this technique are the crossstrung harp and the inline chromatic harp The crossstrung harp has one row diatonic strings and separate row chromatic notes angled shape that the row which can played the right hand the top may played the left hand the bottom and vice versa This variant was first attested the arpa dos rdenes tworow harp Spain and Portugal the 17th century The inline chromatic harp generally singlecourse harp with all notes the chromatic scale appearing single row Single course inline chromatic harps have been produced least since 1902 when Karl Weigel Hanover patented model inline chromatic harp Amplified electroacoustic hollow body and solid body electric lever harps are produced many harpmakers including Lyon Healy Salvi and Camac They generally use individual piezoelectric sensors for each string often combination with small internal microphones produce mixed electrical signal Hollow body instruments can also played acoustically while solid body instruments must amplified The late20th century gravikord modern purposebuilt electric double harp made stainless steel based the traditional West African kora The modern English word harp comes from the Old English hearpe akin Old High German harpha number nonharplike instruments are colloquially referred harps Chordophones like the aeolian harp wind harp and the autoharp with the piano and harpsichord are not harps but zithers because their strings are not perpendicular their soundboard Similarly the many varieties harp guitar and harp lute while chordophones belong the lute family and are not true harps All forms the lyre and kithara are also not harps but belong the fourth family ancient instruments under the chordophones the lyres The term harp has also been applied many instruments which are not chordophones The vibraphone was and still sometimes referred the vibraharp though has strings and its sound
