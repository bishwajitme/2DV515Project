Medieval music consists songs instrumental pieces and liturgical music from about 500 1400 Medieval music was era Western music including liturgical music also known sacred used for the church and secular music nonreligious music Medieval music includes solely vocal music such Gregorian chant and choral music music for group singers solely instrumental music and music that uses both voices and instruments typically with the instruments accompanying the voices Gregorian chant was sung monks during Catholic Mass The Mass reenactment Christs Last Supper intended provide spiritual connection between man and God Part this connection was established through musicThis era begins with the fall the Western Roman Empire the fifth century and ends sometime the early fifteenth century Establishing the end the medieval era and the beginning the Renaissance music era difficult since the trends started different times different regions The date range this article the one usually adopted musicologists During the Medieval period the foundation was laid for the music notation and music theory practices that would shape Western music into the norms that developed during the commonpractice era period shared music writing practices which encompassed the Baroque music composers from 16001750 such Bach and Classical music period composers from the 1700s such Mozart and Romantic music era composers from the 1800s such Wagner The most obvious these the development comprehensive music notational system which enabled composers write out their song melodies and instrumental pieces parchment paper Prior the development musical notation songs and pieces had learned ear from one person who knew song another person This greatly limited how many people could taught new music and how wide music could spread other regions countries The development music notation made easier disseminate spread songs and musical pieces larger number people and wider geographic area However the theoretical advances particularly regard rhythmthe timing notesand polyphonyusing multiple interweaving melodies the same timeare equally important the development Western music Many instruments used perform medieval music still exist the 21st century but different and typically more technologically developed formscitation needed The flute was made wood the medieval era rather than silver other metal and could made sideblown endblown instrument While modern orchestral flutes are usually made metal and have complex key mechanisms and airtight pads medieval flutes had holes that the performer had cover with the fingers with the recorder The recorder was made wood during the Medieval era and despite the fact that the 2000s may made synthetic materials has more less retained its past form The gemshorn similar the recorder has finger holes its front though actually member the ocarina family One the flutes predecessors the pan flute was popular medieval times and possibly Hellenic origin This instruments pipes were made wood and were graduated length produce different pitchescitation needed Medieval music used many plucked string instruments like the lute fretted instrument with pearshaped hollow body which the predecessor the modern guitar Other plucked stringed instruments included the mandore gittern citole and psaltery The dulcimers similar structure the psaltery and zither were originally plucked but musicians began strike the dulcimer with hammers the 14th century after the arrival new metal technology that made metal strings possiblecitation needed The bowed lyra the Byzantine Empire was the first recorded European bowed string instrument Like the modern violin performer produced sound moving bow with tensioned hair over tensioned strings The Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih the 9th century 911 cited the Byzantine lyra his lexicographical discussion instruments bowed instrument equivalent the Arab rabb and typical

wooden wheel attached crank bow its strings Instruments without sound boxes like the jaw harp were also popular Early versions the pipe organ fiddle vielle and precursor the modern trombone called the sackbut were usednot citation given Medieval music was composed and for some vocal and instrumental music improvised for many different music genres styles music Medieval music created for sacred church use and secular nonreligious use was typically written composers except for some sacred vocal and secular instrumental music which was improvised made onthespot During the earlier medieval period the liturgical genre predominantly Gregorian chant done monks was monophonic monophonic means single melodic line without harmony part instrumental accompaniment Polyphonic genres which multiple independent melodic lines are performed simultaneously began develop during the high medieval era becoming prevalent the later 13th and early 14th century The development polyphonic forms with different voices interweaving often associated with the late Medieval Ars nova style which flourished the 1300s The Ars Nova which means new art was innovative style writing music that served key transition from the medieval music style the more expressive styles the post1400s Renaissance music era The earliest innovations upon monophonic plainchant were heterophonic Heterophony the performance the same melody two different performers the same time which each performer slightly alters the ornaments she using Another simple form heterophony for singers sing the same shape melody but with one person singing the melody and second person singing the melody higher lower pitch Organum for example expanded upon plainchant melody using accompanying line sung fixed interval often perfect fifth perfect fourth away from the main melody with resulting alternation between simple form polyphony and monophony The principles organum date back anonymous 9th century tract the Musica enchiriadis which established the tradition duplicating preexisting plainchant parallel motion the interval octave fifth fourth greater sophistication was the motet which developed from the clausula genre medieval plainchant The motet would become the most popular form medieval polyphony While early motets were liturgical sacred designed for use church service the end the thirteenth century the genre had expanded include secular topics such courtly love Courtly love was the respectful veneration lady from afar amorous noble man Many popular motets had lyrics about mans love and adoration beautiful noble and muchadmired womancitation needed The Medieval motet developed during the Renaissance music era after 1400 During the Renaissance the Italian secular genre the Madrigal became popular Similar the polyphonic character the motet madrigals featured greater fluidity and motion the leading melody line The madrigal form also gave rise polyphonic canons songs which multiple singers sing the same melody but starting different times especially Italy where they were called caccie These were threepart secular pieces which featured the two higher voices canon with underlying instrumental longnote accompaniment Finally purely instrumental music also developed during this period both the context growing theatrical tradition and for court performances for the aristocracy Dance music often improvised around familiar tropes was the largest purely instrumental genre The secular Ballata which became very popular Trecento Italy had its origins for instance medieval instrumental dance music During the Medieval period the foundation was laid for the notational and theoretical practices that would shape Western music into the norms that developed during the common practice era The most obvious these the development comprehensive music notational system however the theoretical advances particularly regard rhythm and polyphony are equally important the development Western music The earliest Medieval music did not have any kind notational system The tunes were primarily monophonic single melody without accompaniment and transmitted oral tradition Rome tried centralize the various liturgies and establish the Roman rite the primary church tradition the need transmit these chant melodies across vast distances effectively was equally glaring long music could only taught people ear limited the ability the church get different regions sing the same melodies since each new person would have spend time with person who already knew song and learn ear The first step fix this problem came with the introduction various signs written above the chant texts indicate direction pitch movement called neumes The origin neumes unclear and subject some debate however most scholars agree that their closest ancestors are the classic Greek and Roman grammatical signs that indicated important points declamation recording the rise and fall the voice The two basic signs the classical grammarians were the acutus indicating raising the voice and the gravis indicating lowering the voice singer reading chant text with neume markings would able get general sense whether the melody line went pitch stayed the same went down pitch For singer who already knew song seeing the written neume markings above the text could help jog his her memory about how the melody went However singer reading chant text with neume markings would not able sight read song which she had never heard sung beforecitation needed These neumes eventually evolved into the basic symbols for neumatic notation the virga rod which indicates higher note and still looked like the acutus from which came and the punctum dot which indicates lower note and the name suggests reduced the gravis symbol point Thus the acutus and the gravis could combined represent graphical vocal inflections the syllable This kind notation seems have developed earlier than the eighth century but the ninth was firmly established the primary method musical notation The basic notation the virga and the punctum remained the symbols for individual notes but other neumes soon developed which showed several notes joined together These new neumescalled ligaturesare essentially combinations the two original signs The first music notation was the use dots over the lyrics chant with some dots being higher lower giving the reader general sense the direction the melody However this form notation only served memory aid for singer who already knew the melody This basic neumatic notation could only specify the number notes and whether they moved down There was way indicate exact pitch any rhythm even the starting note These limitations are further indication that the neumes were developed tools support the practice oral tradition rather than supplant However even though started mere memory aid the worth having more specific notation soon became evident The next development musical notation was heighted neumes which neumes were carefully placed different heights relation each other This allowed the neumes give rough indication the size given interval well the direction This quickly led one two lines each representing particular note being placed the music with all the neumes relating back them first these lines had particular meaning and instead had letter placed the beginning indicating which note was represented However the lines indicating middle and the fifth below slowly became most common Having been first merely scratched the parchment the lines now were drawn two different colored inks usually red for and yellow green for This was the beginning the musical staff know today The completion the fourline staff usually credited Guido Arezzo 10001050 one the most important musical theorists the Middle Ages While older sources attribute the development the staff Guido some modern scholars suggest that acted more codifier system that was already being developed Either way this new notation allowed singer learn pieces completely unknown him much shorter amount time However even though chant notation had progressed many ways one fundamental problem remained rhythm The neumatic notational system even its fully developed state did not clearly define any kind rhythm for the singing notes The music theory the Medieval period saw several advances over previous practice both regard tonal material texture and rhythm Concerning rhythm this period had several dramatic changes both its conception and notation During the early Medieval period there was method notate rhythm and thus the rhythmical practice this early music subject heated debate among scholars The first kind written rhythmic system developed during the 13th century and was based series modes This rhythmic plan was codified the music theorist Johannes Garlandia author the Mensurabili Musica c1250 the treatise which defined and most completely elucidated these rhythmic modes his treatise Johannes Garlandia describes six species mode six different ways which longs and breves can arranged Each mode establishes rhythmic pattern beats tempora within common unit three tempora perfectio that repeated again and again Furthermore notation without text based chains ligatures the characteristic notations which groups notes are bound one another The rhythmic mode can generally determined the patterns ligatures used Once rhythmic mode had been assigned melodic line there was generally little deviation from that mode although rhythmic adjustments could indicated changes the expected pattern ligatures even the extent changing another rhythmic mode The next step forward concerning rhythm came from the German theorist Franco Cologne his treatise Ars cantus mensurabilis The Art Mensurable Music written around 1280 describes system notation which differently shaped notes have entirely different rhythmic values This striking change from the earlier system Garlandia Whereas before the length the individual note could only gathered from the mode itself this new inverted relationship made the mode dependent uponand determined bythe individual notes figurae that have incontrovertible durational values innovation which had massive impact the subsequent history European music Most the surviving notated music the 13th century uses the rhythmic modes defined Garlandia The step the evolution rhythm came after the turn the 13th century with the development the Ars Nova style The theorist who most well recognized regard this new style Philippe Vitry famous for writing the Ars Nova New Art treatise around 1320 This treatise music gave its name the style this entire era some ways the modern system rhythmic notation began with Vitry who completely broke free from the older idea the rhythmic modes The notational predecessors modern time meters also originate the Ars Nova This new style was clearly built upon the work Franco Cologne Francos system the relationship between breve and semibreves that half breves was equivalent that between breve and long and since for him modus was always perfect grouped threes the tempus beat was also inherently perfect and therefore contained three semibreves Sometimes the context the mode would require group only two semibreves however these two semibreves would always one normal length and one double length thereby taking the same space time and thus preserving the perfect subdivision the tempus This ternary division held for all note values contrast the Ars Nova period introduced two important changes the first was even smaller subdivision notes semibreves could now divided into minim and the second was the development mensuration Mensurations could combined various manners produce metrical groupings These groupings mensurations are the precursors simple and compound meter the time Ars Nova the perfect division the tempus was not the only option duple divisions became more accepted For Vitry the breve could divided for entire composition section one into groups two three smaller semibreves This way the tempus the term that came denote the division the breve could either perfect tempus perfectum with ternary subdivision imperfect tempus imperfectum with binary subdivision similar fashion the semibreves division termed prolation could divided into three minima prolatio perfectus major prolation two minima prolatio imperfectus minor prolation and the higher level the longs division called modus could three two breves modus perfectus perfect mode modus imperfectus imperfect mode respectively Vitry took this step further indicating the proper division given piece the beginning through the use mensuration sign equivalent our modern time signature Tempus perfectum was indicated circle while tempus imperfectum was denoted halfcircle the current symbol used alternative for the time signature actually holdover this symbol not letter abbreviation for common time popularly believed While many these innovations are ascribed Vitry and somewhat present the Ars Nova treatise was contemporaryand personal acquaintanceof Vitry named Johannes Muris Jehan des Mars who offered the most comprehensive and systematic treatment the new mensural innovations the Ars Nova for brief explanation the mensural notation general see the article Renaissance music Many scholars citing lack positive attributory evidence now consider Vitrys treatise anonymous but this does not diminish its importance for the history rhythmic notation However this makes the first definitely identifiable scholar accept and explain the mensural system Muris who can said have done for what Garlandia did for the rhythmic modes For the duration the medieval period most music would composed primarily perfect tempus with special effects created sections imperfect tempus there great current controversy among musicologists whether such sections were performed with breve equal length whether changed and what proportion This Ars Nova style remained the primary rhythmical system until the highly syncopated works the Ars subtilior the end the 14th century characterized extremes notational and rhythmic complexity This subgenera pushed the rhythmic freedom provided Ars Nova its limits with some compositions having different voices written different mensurations simultaneously The rhythmic complexity that was realized this music comparable that the 20th century equal importance the overall history western music theory were the textural changes that came with the advent polyphony This practice shaped western music into the harmonically dominated music that know today The first accounts this textural development were found two anonymous yet widely circulated treatises music the Musica and the Scolica enchiriadis These texts are dated sometime within the last half the ninth century The treatises describe technique that seemed already well established practice This early polyphony based three simple and three compound intervals The first group comprises fourths fifths and octaves while the second group has octaveplusfourths octaveplusfifths and double octaves This new practice given the name organum the author the treatises Organum can further classified depending the time period which was written The early organum described the enchiriadis can termed strict organum Strict organum can turn subdivided into two types diapente organum the interval fifth and diatesseron organum the interval fourth However both these kinds strict organum had problems with the musical rules the time either them paralleled original chant for too long depending the mode tritone would result This problem was somewhat overcome with the use second type organum This second style organum was called free organum Its distinguishing factor that the parts did not have move only parallel motion but could also move oblique contrary motion This made much easier avoid the dreaded tritone The final style organum that developed was known melismatic organum which was rather dramatic departure from the rest the polyphonic music this point This new style was not note against note but was rather one sustained line accompanied florid melismatic line This final kind organum was also incorporated the most famous polyphonic composer this timeLonin united this style with measured discant passages which used the rhythmic modes create the pinnacle organum composition This final stage organum sometimes referred Notre Dame school polyphony since that was where Lonin and his student Protin were stationed Furthermore this kind polyphony influenced all subsequent styles with the later polyphonic genera motets starting trope existing Notre Dame organums Another important element Medieval music theory was the system which pitches were arranged and understood During the Middle Ages this systematic arrangement series whole steps and half steps what now call scale was known modecitation needed The modal system worked like the scales today insomuch that provided the rules and material for melodic writing The eight church modes are Dorian Hypodorian Phrygian Hypophrygian Lydian Hypolydian Mixolydian and Hypomixolydian Much the information concerning these modes well the practical application them was codified the 11th century the theorist Johannes Afflighemensis his work describes three defining elements each mode the final finalis the reciting tone tenor confinalis and the range ambitus The finalis the tone that serves the focal point for the mode and the name suggests almost always used the final tone The reciting tone the tone that serves the primary focal point the melody particularly internally generally also the tone most often repeated the piece and finally the range delimits the upper and lower tones for given mode The eight modes can further divided into four categories based their final finalis Medieval theorists called these pairs maneriae and labeled them according the Greek ordinal numbers Those modes that have and their final are put into the groups protus deuterus tritus and tetrardus respectively These can then divided further based whether the mode authentic plagal These distinctions deal with the range the mode relation the final The authentic modes have range that about octave one tone above below allowed and start the final whereas the plagal modes while still covering about octave start perfect fourth below the authentic Another interesting aspect the modal system the universal allowance for altering matter what the modeverification needed The inclusion this tone has several uses but one that seems particularly common order avoid melodic difficulties caused once again the tritone These ecclesiastical modes although they have Greek names have little relationship the modes set out Greek theorists Rather most the terminology seems misappropriation the part the medieval theorists Although the church modes have relation the ancient Greek modes the overabundance Greek terminology does point interesting possible origin the liturgical melodies the Byzantine tradition This system called octoechos and also divided into eight categories called echoi For specific medieval music theorists see also Isidore Seville Aurelian Rme Odo Cluny Guido Arezzo Hermannus Contractus

Croix and Philippe Vitry Chant plainsong monophonic sacred single unaccompanied melody form which represents the earliest known music the Christian church Chant developed separately several European centres Although the most important were Rome Hispania Gaul Milan and Ireland there were others well These styles were all developed support the regional liturgies used when celebrating the Mass there Each area developed its own chant and rules for celebration Spain and Portugal Mozarabic chant was used and shows the influence North African music The Mozarabic liturgy even survived through Muslim rule though this was isolated strand and this music was later suppressed attempt enforce conformity the entire liturgy Milan Ambrosian chant named after Ambrose was the standard while Beneventan chant developed around Benevento another Italian liturgical center Gallican chant was used Gaul and Celtic chant Ireland and Great Britain Around 1011 the Roman Catholic Church wanted standardize the Mass and chant across its empire this time Rome was the religious centre western Europe and Paris was the political centre The standardization effort consisted mainly combining these two Roman and Gallican regional liturgies Pope Gregory 540604 and Charlemagne 742814 sent trained singers throughout the Holy Roman Empire 8009621806 teach this new form chant This body chant became known Gregorian Chant named after Pope Gregory the 12th and 13th centuries Gregorian chant had superseded all the other Western chant traditions with the exception the Ambrosian chant Milan and the Mozarabic chant few specially designated Spanish chapels Hildegard von Bingen 10981179 was the earliest known female composer She wrote many monophonic works for the Catholic Church almost all them for female voices Around the end the 9th century singers monasteries such Gall Switzerland began experimenting with adding another part the chant generally voice parallel motion singing mostly perfect fourths fifths above the original tune see interval This development called organum and represents the beginnings counterpoint and ultimately harmony Over the next several centuries organum developed several ways The most significant these developments was the creation florid organum around 1100 sometimes known the school Martial named after monastery southcentral France which contains the bestpreserved manuscript this repertory florid organum the original tune would sung long notes while accompanying voice would sing many notes each one the original often highly elaborate fashion all the while emphasizing the perfect consonances fourths fifths and octaves the earlier organa Later developments organum occurred England where the interval the third was particularly favoured and where organa were likely improvised against existing chant melody and Notre Dame Paris which was the centre musical creative activity throughout the thirteenth century Much the music from the early medieval period anonymous Some the names may have been poets and lyric writers and the tunes for which they wrote words may have been composed others Attribution monophonic music the medieval period not always reliable Surviving manuscripts from this period include the Musica Enchiriadis Codex Calixtinus Santiago Compostela the Magnus Liber and the Winchester Troper For information about specific composers poets writing during the early medieval period see Pope Gregory Godric Hildegard Bingen Hucbald Notker Balbulus Odo Arezzo Odo Cluny and Tutilo Another musical tradition Europe originating during the early Middle Ages was the liturgical drama Liturgical drama developed possibly the 10th century from the tropespoetic embelishments the liturgical texts One the tropes the socalled Quem Quaeritis

Europecitation needed Shortlyclarification needed similar Christmas play was developed musically and textually following the Easter one and other plays followed There controversy among musicologists the instrumental accompaniment such plays given that the stage directions very elaborate and precise other respects not request any participation instrumentscitation needed These dramas were performed monks nuns and priestscitation needed contrast secular plays which were spoken the liturgical drama was always sungcitation needed Many have been preserved sufficiently allow modern reconstruction and performance for example the Play Daniel which has been recently recorded least ten times The Goliards were itinerant poetmusicians Europe from the tenth the middle the thirteenth century Most were scholars ecclesiastics and they wrote and sang Latin Although many the poems have survived very little the music has They were possibly influentialeven decisively soon the troubadourtrouvre tradition

sources Goliards chansons the Carmina Buranacitation needed The flowering the Notre Dame school polyphony from around 1150 1250 corresponded the equally impressive achievements Gothic architecture indeed the centre activity was the cathedral Notre Dame itself Sometimes the music this period called the Parisian school Parisian organum and represents the beginning what conventionally known Ars antiqua This was the period which rhythmic notation first appeared western music mainly contextbased method rhythmic notation known the rhythmic modes This was also the period which concepts formal structure developed which were attentive proportion texture and architectural effect Composers the period alternated florid and discant organum more noteagainstnote opposed the succession manynote melismas against longheld notes found the florid type and created several new musical forms clausulae which were melismatic sections organa extracted and fitted with new words and further musical elaboration conductus which was song for one more voices sung rhythmically most likely procession some sort and tropes which were additions new words and sometimes new music sections older chant All these genres save one were based upon chant that one the voices usually three though sometimes four nearly always the lowest the tenor this point sang chant melody though with freely composed notelengths over which the other voices sang organum The exception this method was the conductus twovoice composition that was freely composed its entiretycitation needed The motet one the most important musical forms the high Middle Ages and Renaissance developed initially during the Notre Dame period out the clausula especially the form using multiple voices elaborated Protin who paved the way for this particularly replacing many his predecessor canon the cathedral Lonins lengthy florid clausulae with substitutes discant style Gradually there came entire books these substitutes available fitted and out the various chants Since fact there were more than can possibly have been used context probable that the clausulae came performed independently either other parts the mass private devotions The clausulae thus practised became the motet when troped with nonliturgical words and were further developed into form great elaboration sophistication and subtlety the fourteenth century the period Ars nova Surviving manuscripts from this era include the Montpellier Codex Bamberg Codex and Las Huelgas Codex Composers this time include Lonin Protin Wycombe Adam Victor and Petrus Cruce Pierre Croix Petrus credited with the innovation writing more than three semibreves fit the length breve Coming before the innovation imperfect tempus this practice inaugurated the era what are now called Petronian motets These late 13thcentury works are three four parts and have multiple texts sung simultaneously Originally the tenor line from the Latin tenere hold held preexisting liturgical chant line the original Latin while the text the one two even three voices above called the voces organales provided commentary the liturgical subject either Latin the vernacular French The rhythmic values the voces organales decreased the parts multiplied with the duplum the part above the tenor having smaller rhythmic values than the tenor the triplum the line above the duplum having smaller rhythmic values than the duplum and time went the texts the voces organales became increasingly secular nature and had less and less overt connection the liturgical text the tenor line The Petronian motet highly complex genre given its mixture several semibreve breves with rhythmic modes and sometimes with increasing frequency substitution secular songs for chant the tenor Indeed everincreasing rhythmic complexity would fundamental characteristic the 14th century though music France Italy and England would take quite different paths during that timecitation needed The Cantigas Santa Maria Canticles Holy Mary Portuguese Galician are 420 poems with musical notation written GalicianPortuguese during the reign Alfonso Sabio 12211284 and often attributed him one the largest collections monophonic solo songs from the Middle Ages and characterized the mention the Virgin Mary every song while every tenth song hymn The manuscripts have survived four codices two Escorial one Madrids National Library and one Florence Italy Some have colored miniatures showing pairs musicians playing wide variety instruments The music the troubadours and trouvres was vernacular tradition monophonic secular song probably accompanied instruments sung professional occasionally itinerant musicians who were skilled poets they were singers and instrumentalists The language the troubadours was Occitan also known the langue doc Provenal the language the trouvres was Old French also known langue doil The period the troubadours corresponded the flowering cultural life Provence which lasted through the twelfth century and into the first decade the thirteenth Typical subjects troubadour song were war chivalry and courtly lovethe love idealized woman from afar The period the troubadours wound down after the Albigensian Crusade the fierce campaign Pope Innocent III eliminate the Cathar heresy and northern barons desire appropriate the wealth the south Surviving troubadours went either Portugal Spain northern Italy northern France where the trouvre tradition lived where their skills and techniques contributed the later developments secular musical culture those places The trouvres and troubadours shared similar musical styes but the trouvres were generally noblemen The music the trouvres was similar that the troubadours but was able survive into the thirteenth century unaffected the Albigensian Crusade Most the more than two thousand surviving trouvre songs include music and show sophistication great that the poetry accompaniescitation needed The Minnesinger tradition was the Germanic counterpart the activity the troubadours and trouvres the west Unfortunately few sources survive from the time the sources Minnesang are mostly from two three centuries after the peak the movement leading some controversy over the accuracy these sources Among the Minnesingers with surviving music are Wolfram von Eschenbach Walther von der Vogelweide and Niedhart von Reuenthal the Middle Ages GalicianPortuguese was the language used nearly all Iberia for lyric poetry From this language derive both modern Galician and Portuguese The GalicianPortuguese school which was influenced some extent mainly certain formal aspects the Occitan troubadours first documented the end the twelfth century and lasted until the middle the fourteenth The earliest extant composition this school usually agreed Ora faz ost senhor Navarra the Portuguese Joo Soares Paiva usually dated just before after 1200 The troubadours the movement not confused with the Occitan troubadours who frequented courts nearby Len and Castile wrote almost entirely cantigas Beginning probably around the middle the thirteenth century these songs known also cantares trovas began compiled collections known cancioneiros songbooks Three such anthologies are known the Cancioneiro Ajuda the Cancioneiro ColocciBrancuti Cancioneiro Biblioteca Nacional Lisboa and the Cancioneiro Vaticana addition these there the priceless collection over 400 GalicianPortugues cantigas the Cantigas Santa Maria which tradition attributes Alfonso The GalicianPortuguese cantigas can divided into three basic genres malevoiced love poetry called cantigas amor cantigas damor femalevoiced love poetry called cantigas amigo cantigas damigo and poetry insult and mockery called cantigas descarnho mal dizer All three are lyric genres the technical sense that they were strophic songs with either musical accompaniment introduction stringed instrument But all three genres also have dramatic elements leading early scholars characterize them lyricdramatic The origins the cantigas damor are usually traced Provenal and Old French lyric poetry but formally and rhetorically they are quite different The cantigas damigo are probably rooted native song tradition Lang 1894full citation needed Michalis 1904full citation needed though this view has been contested The cantigas descarnho maldizer may also according Lang have deep local roots The latter two genres totalling around 900 texts make the GalicianPortuguese lyric unique the entire panorama medieval Romance poetry The beginning the Ars nova one the few clear chronological divisions medieval music since corresponds the publication the Roman Fauvel huge compilation poetry and music 1310 and 1314 The Roman Fauvel satire abuses the medieval church and filled with medieval motets lais rondeaux and other new secular forms While most the music anonymous contains several pieces Philippe Vitry one the first composers the isorhythmic motet development which distinguishes the fourteenth century The isorhythmic motet was perfected Guillaume Machaut the finest composer the time During the Ars nova era secular music acquired polyphonic sophistication formerly found only sacred music development not surprising considering the secular character the early Renaissance while this music typically considered medieval the social forces that produced were responsible for the beginning the literary and artistic Renaissance Italythe distinction between Middle Ages and Renaissance blurry one especially considering arts different music and painting The term Ars nova new art new technique was coined Philippe Vitry his treatise that name probably written 1322 order distinguish the practice from the music the immediately preceding age The dominant secular genre the Ars Nova was the chanson would continue France for another two centuries These chansons were composed musical forms corresponding the poetry they set which were the socalled formes fixes rondeau ballade and virelai These forms significantly affected the development musical structure ways that are felt even today for example the ouvertclos rhymescheme shared all three demanded

cantalina style with florid top voice supported two even one fair amount Italian Trecento music for only two voices that are more regular and slower moving This type texture remained feature Italian music the popular 15th and 16th century secular genres well and was important influence the eventual development the trio texture that revolutionized music the 17th There were three main forms for secular works the Trecento One was the madrigal not the same that 150250 years later but with verserefrainlike form Threeline stanzas each with different words alternated with twoline ritornello with the same text each appearance Perhaps can see the seeds the subsequent lateRenaissance and Baroque ritornello this device too returns again and again recognizable each time contrast with its surrounding disparate sections Another form the caccia chase was written for two voices canon the unison Sometimes this form also featured ritornello which was occasionally also canonic style Usually the name this genre provided double meaning since the texts caccia were primarily about hunts and related outdoor activities least actionfilled scenes The third main form was the ballata which was roughly equivalent the French virelai Surviving Italian manuscripts include the Squarcialupi Codex and the Rossi Codex For information about specific Italian composers writing the late medieval era
