Culture music cognition refers the impact that persons culture has their music cognition including their preferences emotion recognition and musical memory Musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning infancy and adults classification the emotion musical piece depends both culturally specific and universal structural features Additionally individuals musical memory abilities are greater for culturally familiar music than for culturally unfamiliar music The sum these effects makes culture powerful influence music cognition Culturally bound preferences and familiarity for music begin infancy and continue through adolescence and adulthood People tend prefer and remember music from their own cultural tradition Ethnomusicologists people who study the relationship between music and culture never truly understand the music the culture that they are studying even they spend years their lives with that culture they never really understand Familiarity for culturally regular meter styles already place for young infants only few months age The looking times 8month old Western infants indicate that they prefer Western meter music while Turkish infants the same age prefer both Turkish and Western meters Western meters not being completely unfamiliar Turkish culture Both groups preferred either meter when compared with arbitrary meter addition influencing preference for meter culture affects peoples ability correctly identify music styles Adolescents from Singapore and the rated familiarity and preference for excerpts Chinese Malay and Indian music styles Neither group demonstrated preference for the Indian music samples although the Singaporean teenagers recognized them Participants from Singapore showed higher preference for and ability recognize the Chinese and Malay samples participants showed little preference recognition for any the music samples those types music are not present their native culture individuals musical experience may affect how they formulate preferences for music from their own culture and other cultures American and Japanese individuals nonmusic majors both indicated preference for Western music but Japanese individuals were more receptive Eastern music Among the participants there was one group with little musical experience and one group that had received supplemental musical experience their lifetimes Although both American and Japanese participants disliked formal Eastern styles music and preferred Western styles music participants with greater musical experience showed wider range preference responses not specific their own culture Bimusicalism phenomenon which people wellversed and familiar with music from two different cultures exhibit dual sensitivity both genres music study conducted with participants familiar with Western Indian and both Western and Indian music the bimusical participants exposed both Indian and Western styles showed bias for either music style recognition tasks and did not indicate that one style music was more tense than the other contrast the Western and Indian participants more successfully recognized music from their own culture and felt the other cultures music was more tense the whole These results indicate that everyday exposure music from both cultures can result cognitive sensitivity music styles from those cultures Bilingualism typically confers specific preferences for the language lyrics song When monolingual Englishspeaking and bilingual Spanish and Englishspeaking sixth graders listened the same song played instrumental English Spanish version ratings preference showed that bilingual students preferred the Spanish version while monolingual students more often preferred the instrumental version the childrens selfreported distraction was the same for all excerpts Spanish bilingual speakers also identified most closely with the Spanish song Thus the language lyrics interacts with listeners culture and language abilities affect preferences The cueredundancy model emotion recognition music differentiates between universal structural auditory cues and culturally bound learned auditory cues see schematic below Structural cues that span all musical traditions include dimensions such pace tempo loudness and timbre Fast tempo for example typically associated with happiness regardless listeners cultural background Culturespecific cues rely knowledge the conventions particular musical tradition Ethnomusicologist have said that there are certain situations that certain song would sung different cultures These times are marked cultural cues and the people that culture particular timbre may interpreted reflect one emotion Western listeners and another emotion Eastern listeners There could other culturally bound cues well for example rock roll music usually identified rebellious type music associated with teenagers and the music reflects their ideals and beliefs that their culture believes According the cueredundancy model individuals exposed music from their own cultural tradition utilize both psychophysical and culturally bound cues identifying emotionality Conversely perception intended emotion unfamiliar music relies solely universal psychophysical properties Japanese listeners accurately categorize angry joyful and happy musical excerpts from familiar traditions Japanese and Western samples and relatively unfamiliar traditions Hindustani Simple fast melodies receive joyful ratings from these participants simple slow samples receive sad ratings and loud complex excerpts are perceived angry Strong relationships between emotional judgments and structural acoustic cues suggest the importance universal musical properties categorizing unfamiliar music When both Korean and American participants judged the intended emotion Korean folksongs the American groups identification happy and sad songs was equivalent levels observed for Korean listeners Surprisingly Americans exhibited greater accuracy anger assessments than the Korean group The latter result implies cultural differences anger perception occur independently familiarity while the similarity American and Korean happy and sad judgments indicates the role universal auditory cues emotional perception Categorization unfamiliar music varies with intended emotion Timbre mediates Western listeners recognition angry and peaceful Hindustani songs Flute timbre supports the detection peace whereas string timbre aids anger identification Happy and sad assessments the other hand rely primarily relatively lowlevel structural information such tempo Both lowlevel cues slow tempo and timbre aid the detection peaceful music but only timbre cued anger recognition Communication peace therefore takes place multiple structural levels while anger seems conveyed nearly exclusively timbre Similarities between aggressive vocalizations and angry music roughness may contribute the salience timbre anger assessments The stereotype theory emotion music STEM suggests that cultural stereotyping may affect emotion perceived music STEM argues that for some listeners with low expertise emotion perception music based stereotyped associations held the listener about the encoding culture the music the culture representative particular music genre such Brazilian culture encoded Bossa Nova music STEM extension the cueredundancy model because addition arguing for two sources emotion some cultural cues can now specifically explained terms stereotyping Particularly STEM provides more specific predictions namely that emotion music dependent some extent the cultural stereotyping the music genre being perceived Because musical complexity psychophysical dimension the cueredundancy model predicts that complexity perceived independently experience However South African and Finnish listeners assign different complexity ratings identical African folk songs Thus the cueredundancy model may overly simplistic its distinctions between structural feature detection and cultural learning least the case complexity When listening music from within ones own cultural tradition repetition plays key role emotion judgments American listeners who hear classical jazz excerpts multiple times rate the elicited and conveyed emotion the pieces higher relative participants who hear the pieces once Methodological limitations previous studies preclude complete understanding the roles psychophysical cues emotion recognition Divergent mode and tone cues elicit mixed affect demonstrating the potential for mixed emotional percepts Use dichotomous scales simple happysad ratings may mask this phenomenon these tasks require participants report single component multidimensional affective experience Enculturation powerful influence music memory Both longterm and working memory systems are critically involved the appreciation and comprehension music Longterm memory enables the listener develop musical expectation based previous experience while working memory necessary relate pitches one another phrase between phrases and throughout piece Neuroscientific evidence suggests that memory for music least part special and distinct from other forms memory The neural processes music memory retrieval share much with the neural processes verbal memory retrieval indicated functional magnetic resonance imaging studies comparing the brain areas activated during each task Both musical and verbal memory retrieval activate the left inferior frontal cortex which thought involved executive function especially executive function verbal retrieval and the posterior middle temporal cortex which thought involved semantic retrieval However musical semantic retrieval also bilaterally activates the superior temporal gyri containing the primary auditory cortex Despite the universality music enculturation has pronounced effect individuals memory for music Evidence suggests that people develop their cognitive understanding music from their cultures People are best recognizing and remembering music the style their native culture and their music recognition and memory better for music from familiar but nonnative cultures than for music from unfamiliar cultures Part the difficulty remembering culturally unfamiliar music may arise from the use different neural processes when listening familiar and unfamiliar music For instance brain areas involved attention including the right angular gyrus and middle frontal gyrus show increased activity when listening culturally unfamiliar music compared novel but culturally familiar music Enculturation affects music memory early childhood before childs cognitive schemata for music fully formed perhaps beginning early one year age Like adults children are also better able remember novel music from their native culture than from unfamiliar ones although they are less capable than adults remembering more complex music Childrens developing music cognition may influenced the language their native culture For instance children Englishspeaking cultures develop the ability identify pitches from familiar songs years old while Japanese children develop the same ability age This difference may due the Japanese languages use pitch accents which encourages better pitch discrimination early age rather than the stress accents upon which English relies Enculturation also biases listeners expectations such that they expect hear tones that correspond culturally familiar modal traditions For example Western participants presented with series pitches followed test tone not present the original series were more likely mistakenly indicate that the test tone was originally present the tone was derived from Western scale than was derived from culturally unfamiliar scale Recent research indicates that deviations from expectations music may prompt outgroup derogation Despite the powerful effects music enculturation evidence indicates that cognitive comprehension and affinity for different cultural modalities somewhat plastic One longterm instance plasticity bimusicalism musical phenomenon akin bilingualism Bimusical individuals frequently listen music from two cultures and not demonstrate the biases recognition memory and perceptions tension displayed individuals whose listening experience limited one musical tradition Other evidence suggests that some changes music appreciation and comprehension can occur over short period time For instance after half hour passive exposure original melodies using familiar Western pitches unfamiliar musical grammar harmonic structure the BohlenPierce scale Western participants demonstrated increased recognition memory and greater affinity for melodies this grammar This suggests that even very brief exposure unfamiliar music can rapidly affect music perception and memory
