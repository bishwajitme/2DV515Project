decorates and elaborates the plain melodic line The fifth variation breaks the steady pulse and creates syncopated offbeats The seventh variation introduces powerful new chords which replace the

had composed Beethoven contributed mighty set variations this theme The thirteenth these stands out its seemingly wilful eccentricity and determination reduce the given material its bare bones Wilfrid Mellers describes this variation comically disruptive The original tonal sequence telescoped the twobar sequences being absorbed into the silences Many composers have taken pieces composed others basis for elaboration John Dowlands Lachrimae was frequently used other composers basis for sets variations during the 17th century Composed 1700 the final movement Arcangelo Corellis Violin Sonata opens with this rather sparse melodic line Corellis fellowcomposer and former student Francesco Geminiani produced playing version follows According Nicholas Cook Geminianis version all the notes Corellis violin line are absorbed into quite new melodic organization With its characteristic rhythmic pattern Geminianis opening tune way that Corellis not whereas the original version the first four bars consist undifferentiated stream quarternotes and make single phrase Geminianis version has three sequential repetitions distinctive onebar phrase and contrasted closing phrase producing strongly accented downbeat quality Jazz arrangers frequently develop variations themes other composers For example Gil Evans 1959 arrangement George Gershwins song Summertime from the opera Porgy and Bess example variation through changing orchestral timbre the outset Evans presents single variation that repeats five times subtly differing instrumental combinations These create compelling background constantlychanging sonic tapestry over which trumpeter Miles Davis freely improvises his own set variations Wilfrid Mellers 1964 wrote that called for improviser Daviss kind and quality explore through Gil Evans arrangement the tender frailty inherent the Summertime tune Between them solo line and harmonic colour create music that once innocent and tense with apprehension Variation forms include ground bass passacaglia chaconne and theme and variations Ground bass passacaglia and chaconne are typically based brief ostinato motifs providing repetitive harmonic basis and are also typically continuous evolving structures Theme and variation forms are however based specifically melodic variation which the fundamental musical idea theme repeated altered form accompanied different manner Theme and variation structure generally begins with theme which itself sometimes preceded introduction typically between eight and thirtytwo bars length each variation particularly music the eighteenth century and earlier will the same length and structure the theme This form may part have derived from the practical inventiveness musicians Court dances were long the tunes which accompanied them were short Their repetition became intolerably wearisome and inevitably led the player indulge extempore variation and ornament however the format the dance required these variations maintain the same duration and shape the tune Variation forms can written freestanding pieces for solo instruments ensembles can constitute movement larger piece Most jazz music structured basic pattern theme and variations Examples include John Bulls Salvator Mundi Bachs Canonic Variations Vom Himmel hoch komm ich her Passacaglia and Fugue minor Violin Chaconne and minor solo violin suite Corellis Folia Variations Beethovens Diabelli Variations the Finale Brahmss Fourth Symphony Variations Theme Haydn Elgars Enigma Variations Francks Variations Symphoniques and Richard Strausss Don Quixote Both Schuberts Death and the Maiden Quartet and Trout Quintet take their titles from his songs used variation movements Chopins Berceuse for piano was first called Variantes and consists continouos variations ground bass Although the first isolated example emerged the 14th century works themeandvariation form first emerge the early sixteenth century Possibly the earliest published example the diferencias for vihuela Luis Narvez 1538 favorite form variations Renaissance music was divisions type which the basic rhythmic beat successively divided into smaller and smaller values The basic principle beginning with simple variations and moving more elaborate ones has always been present the history the variation form since provides way giving overall shape variation set rather than letting just form arbitrary sequence Keyboard works variation form were written number 16thcentury English composers including William Byrd Hugh Aston and Giles Farnaby Outstanding examples early Baroque variations are the ciaccone Claudio Monteverdi and Heinrich Schtz Two famous variation sets from the Baroque era both originally written for harpsichord are George Frideric Handels The Harmonious Blacksmith set and Johann Sebastian Bachs Goldberg Variations BWV 988 the Classical era Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote great number variations such the first movement his Piano Sonata 331 the finale his Clarinet Quintet Joseph Haydn specialized sets double variations which two related themes usually minor and major are presented and then varied alternation outstanding examples are the slow movement his Symphony 103 the Drumroll and the Variations minor for piano XVII6 Ludwig van Beethoven wrote many variation sets his career Some were independent sets for instance the Diabelli Variations 120 and the Eroica Variations major Others form single movements parts movements larger works such first movement the Piano Sonata the variations the final movement the Third Symphony Eroica Variation sets also occur several his late works such the slow movement his String Quartet 127 the second movement his final Piano Sonata 111 and the slow third movement the Ninth Symphony Op125 Franz Schubert wrote five variation sets using his own lieder themes Amongst them the slow movement his string quartet Death and the Maiden 810 intense set variations his somber lied 531 the same title Schuberts Piano Quintet The Trout 667 likewise includes variations his song The Trout 550 The second movement the Fantasie major comprises set variations Der Wanderer indeed the work whole takes its popular name from the lied the Romantic era the variation form was developed further 1824 Carl Czerny premiered his Variations for piano and orchestra the Austrian National Hymn Gott erhalte Franz der Kaiser Frdric Chopin wrote four sets for solo piano and also the Variations darem mano from Mozarts opera Don Giovanni for piano and orchestra 1827 further example the form Felix Mendelssohns Variations srieuses Johannes Brahms wrote number sets variations some them rely themes older composers for example the Variations and Fugue Theme Handel 1861 piano and the Variations Theme Haydn 1873 orchestra The latter work believed the first set variations for orchestra alone that was work its own right rather than part symphony suite other larger work Karl Goldmarks Rustic Wedding Symphony 1875 starts out with set variations its first movement Antonn Dvoks Symphonic Variations 1877 and Edward Elgars Enigma Variations 1899 are other wellknown examples Anton Arenskys

often improvise variations theme This was commonplace the Baroque era when the capo aria particularly when slow tempo required the singer able improvise variation during the return the main material During this period according Nicholas Cook was often the case that responsibility for the most highly elaborated stage the compositional process fell not upon the composer but upon the executant their instrumental sonatas composers like Corelli Geminiani and Handel sometimes supplied the performer with only the skeleton the music that was played the ornamentation which contributes crucially the musics effect had provided the performer Cook cites Geminianis elaboration Corelli see above example instance which the composer performer wrote down version one these movements was meant played Musicians the Classical era also could improvise variations both Mozart see Mozarts compositional method and Beethoven made powerful impressions their audiences when they improvised Modern listeners can get sense what these improvised variations sounded like listening published works that evidently are written transcriptions improvised performances particular Beethovens Fantasia Minor and Mozarts Variations Aria Gluck 455 Improvisation elaborate variations popular theme one the core genres jazz According William Austin the practice jazz musicians resembles the variations popular songs composed for the keyboard the end the 16th century Byrd Bull Sweelinck and Frescobaldi more than the cumulative variations Beethoven and Brahms Generally the theme used stated quite explicitly the outset However some jazz musicians employ more oblique approach According Gamble 1984 p13 Charlie Parkers performance Embraceable You can appreciated fully only are familiar with the tune for unlike many jazz performances which the theme stated the beginning followed improvisations the theme Parker launches almost immediately into improvisation stating only fragment the tune the end the piece Coleman Hawkins famous interpretation Body and Soul shows similar approach October 1939 Coleman Hawkins went into New Yorks RCA studios with eightpiece band record the 1930 composition Body and Soul was already favourite among jazz musicians but nobody had ever played like this Pianist Gene Rodgers plays straight fourbar introduction before Hawkins swoops soloing for three minutes without playing single note the tune gliding over the chord changes with such harmonic logic that ends inventing bebop Improvisation means spontaneous variations ornaments embellishments andor alterations melody the basis most subSaharan African music traditional and pop extending from melody and harmony form and rhythmic embellishments
