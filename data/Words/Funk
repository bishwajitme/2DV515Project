Funk deemphasizes melody and chord progressions and focuses strong rhythmic groove bass line played electric bassist and drum part played drummer Like much Africaninspired music funk typically consists complex groove with rhythm instruments playing interlocking grooves Funk uses the same richly colored extended chords found bebop jazz such minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths dominant seventh chords with altered ninths and thirteenths Funk originated the mid1960s with James Browns development signature groove that emphasized the downbeatwith heavy emphasis the first beat every measure The One and the application swung 16th notes and syncopation all bass lines drum patterns and guitar riffs Other musical groups including Sly and the Family Stone the Meters and ParliamentFunkadelic soon began adopt and develop Browns innovations While much the written history funk focuses men there have been notable funk women including Chaka Khan Labelle Lyn Collins Brides

documented English 1620 1784 funky meaning musty was first documented which turn led sense earthy that was taken around 1900 early jazz slang for something deeply strongly felt early jam sessions musicians would encourage one another get down telling one another Now put some stank least early 1907 jazz songs carried titles such Funky The first example unrecorded number Buddy Bolden remembered either Funky Butt Buddy Boldens Blues with improvised lyrics that were according Donald Marquis either comical and light crude and downright obscene but one way another referring the sweaty atmosphere dances where Boldens band played late the 1950s and early 1960s when funk and funky were used increasingly the context jazz music the terms still were considered indelicate and inappropriate for use polite company According one source New Orleansborn drummer Earl Palmer was the first use the word funky explain other musicians that their music should made more syncopated and danceable The style later evolved into rather harddriving insistent rhythm implying more carnal quality This early form the music set the pattern for later musicians The music was identified slow sexy loose rifforiented and danceablecitation needed great deal funk rhythmically based twocelled onbeatoffbeat structure which originated subSaharan African music traditions New Orleans appropriated the bifurcated structure from the AfroCuban mambo and conga the late 1940s and made its own New Orleans funk was called gained international acclaim largely because James Browns rhythm section used great effect Funk creates intense groove using strong guitar riffs and bass lines Like Motown recordings funk songs used bass lines the centerpiece songs Slap basss mixture thumbslapped low notes and finger popped plucked high notes allowed the bass have drumlike rhythmic role which became distinctive element funk funk bands guitarists typically play percussive style using style picking called the chank chicken scratch which the guitar strings are pressed lightly against the fingerboard and then quickly released just enough get muted scratching sound that produced rapid rhythmic strumming the opposite hand near the bridge The result these factors was rhythm guitar sound that seemed float somewhere between the lowend thump the electric bass and the cutting tone the snare and hihats with rhythmically melodic feel that fell deep the pocket Guitarist Jimmy Nolen developed this technique James Browns Give Turnit Loose 1969 however Jimmy Nolens guitar part has bare bones tonal structure The pattern attackpoints the emphasis not the pattern pitches The guitar used the way that African drum idiophone would used Note that the measures alternate between beginning the beat and beginning offbeats Also often used was the application the wahwah sound effect and muting the notes guitar riffs create percussive sound Guitarist Ernie Isley the Isley Brothers and Eddie Hazel Funkadelic were notably influenced Jimi Hendrixs improvised solos Eddie Hazel who worked with George Clinton one the most notable guitar soloists funk Ernie Isley was tutored early age Jimi Hendrix himself when was part the Isley Brothers backing band and temporarily lived the attic the Isleys household Funk uses the same richly coloured extended chords found bebop jazz such minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths dominant seventh chords with altered ninths However unlike bebop jazz with its complex rapidfire chord changes funk virtually abandoned chord changes creating static single chord vamps with melodoharmonic movement and complex driving rhythmic feel Some the best known and most skilful soloists funk have jazz backgrounds Trombonist Fred Wesley and saxophonist Pee Wee Ellis and Maceo Parker are among the most notable musicians the funk music genre with both them working with James Brown George Clinton and Prince The chords used funk songs typically imply dorian mixolydian mode opposed the major

during and after the Civil Rights Movement Funk allowed everyday experiences expressed challenge daily struggles and hardships fought lower and working class communities Gerhard Kubik notes that with the exception New Orleans early blues lacked complex polyrhythms and there was very specific absence asymmetric timeline patterns key patterns virtually all early twentieth century AfricanAmerican music only some New Orleans genres does hint simple time line patterns occasionally appear the form transient socalled stomp patterns stoptime chorus These not function the same way African time lines the late 1940s this changed somewhat when the twocelled time line structure was brought into New Orleans blues New Orleans musicians were especially receptive AfroCuban influences precisely the time when was first forming Dave Bartholomew and Professor Longhair Henry Roeland Byrd incorporated AfroCuban instruments well the clave pattern and related twocelled figures songs such Carnival Day Bartholomew 1949 and Mardi Gras New Orleans Longhair 1949 Robert Palmer reports that the 1940s Professor Longhair listened and played with musicians from the islands and fell under the spell Perez

Clyde Stubblefield was just the epitome this funky drumming Stewart states that the popular feel was passed along from New Orleansthrough James Browns music the popular music the 1970s Concerning the various funk motifs Stewart states This model should noted different from time line such clave and tresillo that not exact pattern but more loose organizing principle 1990 interview Brown offered his reason for switching the rhythm his music changed from the upbeat the downbeat Simple that really According Maceo Parker Browns former saxophonist playing the downbeat was first hard for him and took some getting used Reflecting back his early days with Browns band Parker reported that had difficulty playing the one during solo performances since was used hearing and playing with the accent the
