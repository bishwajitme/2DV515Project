Personalized stations ceased exist though for short time Yahoo did save previous users song artist and album ratings Since the new format organized radio stations via genre listeners had very limited range what music they hear unless they regularly switch from station station The change also eliminated the feature that suggested songs and artists based the users ratings Listeners had the option listen those stations high quality broadband audio well using the skipsperhour not applicable local stations One way around the inability skip songs was simply hit the browsers refresh button While took time for the page reload was faster than waiting for song finish Listeners were allowed use the outoffive rating feature that influences the stations While banning song entirely impossible giving song onestar rating would have played very rarely The rating tool was discontinued from the Yahoo Music Radio player September for time until was restored November Ratings the new player were not yet

countries followed suit prior the relaunch Yahoo Music worldwide sites The LAUNCHcast music player from development date February 2009 required Microsofts Windows Media Player higher function although could not streamed from the Windows Media Player itself Before the merger with CBS Radio LAUNCHcast only worked with Microsofts Internet Explorer and web browser with Flash higher and Yahoos Messenger and Music Engine programs the Microsoft Windows operating system 2000 Professional Home and Professional Firefox web browser LAUNCHcast did not load properly without extra configuration work According Yahoo the LAUNCHcast music player was not compatible with the Mac Linux operating systems however February 2009 that wasnt the case anymore Yahoo stated that following CBSs acquisition loading the player Firefox would become possible Since the relaunch LAUNCHcast CBS users were only required download the latest Flash Player plugin currently Version See external links below for Yahoos help page system requirements The requirement still stands with the YahooiHeartRadio merger Before moving only use Windows Media early video playback offered the choice Windows Media Player RealPlayer which the latter was crossplatform and available for Linux After Windows Media was made the only delivery format requiring Windows Media Player the minimum Firefox failed play videos work around this users had carefully set specialised Windows Media ActiveX extension for Firefox and temporarily tweak the browser user agent with the User Agent Switcher extension identify Internet Explorer order play content This only worked Windows and not Linux Browser and operating system compatibility issues were largely rectified after the default player was changed Flash Player which was crossplatform the extent that supported least Windows Mac and Linux April 2007 Yahoo defeated Sony BMG copyright infringement lawsuit involving LAUNCHcasts personalization features issue was whether not LAUNCHcasts personal radio station constitutes interactive service which requires negotiated license agreement with record company noninteractive service which requires cheaper compulsory license from SoundExchange interactive service users can play songs demand but with LAUNCHcast they can only influence whether not particular song appears their station After sixyear litigation jury decided that LAUNCHcast was not required negotiate licenses interactive service and that the services compulsory licenses noninteractive service were sufficient The plaintiffs appealed the decision but August 2009 the United States Court Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the lower courts decision finding that users did not have sufficient control over the playlists generated LAUNCHcast render interactive service
