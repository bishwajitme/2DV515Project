choreographer Merce Cunningham who was also Cages romantic partner for most their lives Cage perhaps best known for his 1952 composition 433 which performed the absence deliberate sound musicians who present the work nothing aside from being present for the duration specified the title The content the composition not four minutes and seconds silence often assumed but rather the sounds the environment heard the audience during performance The works challenge assumed definitions about musicianship and musical experience made popular and controversial topic both musicology and the broader aesthetics art and performance Cage was also pioneer the prepared piano piano with its sound altered objects placed between its strings hammers for which wrote numerous dancerelated works and few concert pieces The best known these Sonatas and Interludes 194648 His teachers included Henry Cowell 1933 and Arnold Schoenberg 193335 both known for their radical innovations music but Cages major influences lay various East and South Asian cultures Through his studies Indian philosophy and Zen Buddhism the late 1940s Cage came the idea aleatoric chancecontrolled music which started composing 1951 The Ching ancient Chinese classic text changing events became Cages standard composition tool for the rest his life 1957 lecture Experimental Music described music purposeless play which affirmation life not attempt bring order out chaos nor suggest improvements creation but simply way waking the very life were living Cage was born September 1912 Good Samaritan Hospital downtown Los Angeles His father John Milton Cage 18861964 was inventor and his mother Lucretia Crete Harvey 18851969 worked intermittently journalist for the Los Angeles Times The familys roots were deeply American 1976 interview Cage mentioned that George Washington was assisted ancestor named John Cage the task surveying the Colony Virginia Cage described his mother woman with sense society who was never happy while his father perhaps best characterized his inventions sometimes idealistic such dieselfueled submarine that gave off exhaust bubbles the senior Cage being uninterested undetectable submarine others revolutionary and against the scientific norms such the electrostatic field theory the universe John Milton taught his son that someone says cant that shows you what 194445 Cage wrote two small character pieces dedicated his parents Crete and Dad The latter short lively piece that ends abruptly while Crete slightly longer mostly melodic contrapuntal work Cages first experiences with music were from private piano teachers the Greater Los Angeles area and several relatives particularly his aunt Phoebe Harvey James who introduced him the piano music the 19th century received first piano lessons when was the fourth grade school but although liked music expressed more interest sight reading than developing virtuoso piano technique and apparently was not thinking composition During high school one his music teachers was Fannie Charles Dillon 1928 though Cage was convinced that wanted writer graduated that year from Los Angeles High School valedictorian having also the spring given prizewinning speech the Hollywood Bowl proposing day quiet for all Americans being hushed and silent said should have the opportunity hear what other people think anticipating 433 more than thirty yearscitation needed Cage enrolled Pomona College Claremont theology major 1928 Often crossing disciplines again though encountered Pomona the work artist Marcel Duchamp via professor Jos Pijoan writer James Joyce via Don Sample philosopher Ananda Coomaraswamy and Cowell 1930 dropped out having come believe that college was use writer after incident described the 1991 autobiographical statement was shocked college see one hundred classmates the library all reading copies the same book Instead doing they did went into the stacks and read the first book written author whose name began with received the highest grade the class That convinced that the institution was not being run correctly left Cage persuaded his parents that trip Europe would more beneficial future writer than college studies subsequently hitchhiked Galveston and sailed Havre where took train Paris Cage stayed Europe for some months trying his hand various forms art First studied Gothic and Greek architecture but decided was not interested enough architecture dedicate his life then took painting poetry and music was Europe that encouraged his teacher Lazare Lvy first heard the music contemporary composers such Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith and finally got know the music Johann Sebastian Bach which had not experienced before After several months Paris Cages enthusiasm for America was revived after read Walt Whitmans Leaves Grass wanted return immediately but his parents with whom regularly exchanged letters during the entire trip persuaded him stay Europe for little longer and explore the continent Cage started traveling visited various places France Germany and Spain well Capri and most importantly Majorca where started composing His first compositions were created using dense mathematical formulas but Cage was displeased with the results and left the finished pieces behind when left Cages association with theater also started Europe during walk Seville witnessed his own words the multiplicity simultaneous visual and audible events all going together ones experience and producing enjoyment Cage returned the United States 1931 went Santa Monica California where made living partly giving small private lectures contemporary art got know various important figures the Southern California art world such pianist Richard Buhlig who became his first teacher and arts patron Galka Scheyer 1933 Cage decided concentrate music rather than painting The people who heard music had better things say about than the people who looked paintings had say about paintings Cage later explained 1933 sent some his compositions Henry Cowell the reply was rather vague letter which Cowell suggested that Cage study with Arnold SchoenbergCages musical ideas the time included composition based 25tone row somewhat similar Schoenbergs twelvetone technique Cowell also advised that before approaching Schoenberg Cage should take some preliminary lessons and recommended Adolph Weiss former Schoenberg pupil Following Cowells advice Cage travelled New York City 1933 and started studying with Weiss well taking lessons from Cowell himself The New School supported himself financially taking job washing walls Brooklyn YWCA Cages routine during that period was apparently very tiring with just four hours sleep most nights and four hours composition every day starting 4am Several months later still 1933 Cage became sufficiently good composition approach Schoenberg could not afford Schoenbergs price and when mentioned the older composer asked whether Cage would devote his life music After Cage replied that would Schoenberg offered tutor him free charge Cage studied with Schoenberg California first USC and then UCLA well privately The older composer became one the biggest influences Cage who literally worshipped him particularly example how live ones life being composer The vow Cage gave dedicate his life music was apparently still important some years later when Cage had need for writing music continued composing partly because the promise gave Schoenbergs methods and their influence Cage are well documented Cage himself various lectures and writings Particularly wellknown the conversation mentioned the 1958 lecture Indeterminacy After had been studying with him for two years Schoenberg said order write music you must have feeling for harmony explained him that had feeling for harmony then said that would always encounter obstacle that would though came wall through which could not pass said that case will devote life beating head against that wall Cage studied with Schoenberg for two years but although admired his teacher decided leave after Schoenberg told the assembled students that was trying make impossible for them write music Much later Cage recounted the incident When said that revolted not against him but against what had said determined then and there more than ever before write music Although Schoenberg was not impressed with Cages compositional abilities during these two years later interview where initially said that none his American pupils were interesting further stated reference Cage There was one course hes not composer but hes inventorof genius Cage would later adopt the inventor moniker and deny that was fact composer some point 193435 during his studies with Schoenberg Cage was working his mothers arts and crafts shop where met artist Xenia Andreyevna Kashevaroff She was Alaskanborn daughter Russian priest her work encompassed fine bookbinding sculpture and collage Although Cage was involved relationships with Don Sample and with architect Rudolph Schindlers wife Pauline when met Xenia fell love immediately Cage and Kashevaroff were married the desert Yuma Arizona June 1935 The newly married couple first lived with Cages parents Pacific Palisades then moved Hollywood During 193638 Cage changed numerous jobs including one that started his lifelong association with modern dance dance accompanist UCLA produced music for choreographies and one point taught course Musical Accompaniments for Rhythmic Expression UCLA with his aunt Phoebe was during that time that Cage first started experimenting with unorthodox instruments such household items metal sheets and This was inspired Oskar Fischinger who told Cage that everything the world has spirit that can released through its sound Although Cage did not share the idea spirits these words inspired him begin exploring the sounds produced hitting various nonmusical objects 1938 Cowells recommendation Cage drove San Francisco find employment and seek out fellow Cowell student and composer Lou Harrison According Cowell the two composers had shared interest percussion and dance and would likely hit off introduced one another Indeed the two immediately established strong bond upon meeting and began working relationship that continued for several years Harrison soon helped Cage secure faculty member position Mills College teaching the same program UCLA and collaborating with choreographer Marian van Tuyl Several famous dance groups were present and Cages interest modern dance grew further After several months left and moved Seattle Washington where found work composer and accompanist for choreographer Bonnie Bird the Cornish College the Arts The Cornish School years proved particularly important period Cages life Aside from teaching and working accompanist Cage organized percussion ensemble that toured the West Coast and brought the composer his first fame His reputation was enhanced further with the invention the prepared pianoa piano which has had its sound altered objects placed beneath between the stringsin 1940 This concept was originally intended for performance staged room too small include full percussion ensemble was also the Cornish School that Cage met number people who became lifelong friends such painter Mark Tobey and dancer Merce Cunningham The latter was become Cages lifelong romantic partner and artistic collaborator Cage left Seattle the summer 1941 after the painter Lszl MoholyNagy invited him teach the Chicago School Design what later became the IIT Institute Design The composer accepted partly because hoped find opportunities Chicago that were not available Seattle organize center for experimental music These opportunities did not materialize Cage taught the Chicago School Design and worked accompanist and composer the University Chicago one point his reputation percussion composer landed him commission from the Columbia Broadcasting System compose soundtrack for radio play Kenneth Patchen The result The City Wears Slouch Hat was received well and Cage deduced that more important commissions would follow Hoping find these left Chicago for New York City the spring 1942 New York the Cages first stayed with painter Max Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim Through them Cage met numerous important artists such Piet Mondrian Andr Breton Jackson Pollock Marcel Duchamp and many others Guggenheim was very supportive the Cages could stay with her and Ernst for any length time and she offered organize concert Cages music the opening her gallery which included paying for transportation Cages percussion instruments from Chicago After she learned that Cage secured another concert the Museum Modern Art Guggenheim withdrew all support and even after the ultimately successful MoMA concert Cage was left homeless unemployed and penniless The commissions hoped for did not happen and Xenia spent the summer 1942 with dancer Jean Erdman and her husband Without the percussion instruments Cage again turned prepared piano producing substantial body works for performances various choreographers including Merce Cunningham who had moved New York City several years earlier Cage and Cunningham eventually became romantically involved and Cages marriage already breaking during the early 1940s ended divorce 1945 Cunningham remained Cages partner for the rest his life Cage also countered the lack percussion instruments writing one occasion for voice and closed piano the resulting piece The Wonderful Widow Eighteen Springs 1942 quickly became popular and was performed the celebrated duo Cathy Berberian and Luciano Berio Like his personal life Cages artistic life went through crisis mid1940s The composer was experiencing growing disillusionment with the idea music means communication the public rarely accepted his work and Cage himself too had trouble understanding the music his colleagues early 1946 Cage agreed tutor Gita Sarabhai Indian musician who came the study Western music return asked her teach him about Indian music and philosophy Cage also attended late 1940s and early 1950s Suzukis lectures Zen Buddhism and read further the works Coomaraswamy The first fruits these studies were works inspired Indian concepts Sonatas and Interludes for prepared piano String Quartet Four Parts and others Cage accepted the goal music explained him Sarabhai sober and quiet the mind thus rendering susceptible divine influences Early 1946 his former teacher Richard Buhlig arranged for Cage meet Berlinborn pianist Grete Sultan who had escaped from Nazi persecution New York 1941 They became close lifelong friends and Cage later dedicated part his Music for Piano and his monumental piano cycle Etudes Australes her Sonatas and Interludes were received well the publicaccording whom After 1949 performance Carnegie Hall New York Cage received grant from the Guggenheim Foundation which enabled him make trip Europe where met composers such Olivier Messiaen and Pierre Boulez More important was Cages chance encounter with Morton Feldman New York City early 1950 Both composers attended New York Philharmonic concert where the orchestra performed Anton Weberns Symphony followed piece Sergei Rachmaninoff Cage felt overwhelmed Weberns piece that left before the Rachmaninoff and the lobby met Feldman who was leaving for the same reason The two composers quickly became friends some time later Cage Feldman Earle Brown David Tudor and Cages pupil Christian Wolff came referred the New York school early 1951 Wolff presented Cage with copy the Chinga Chinese classic text which describes symbol system used identify order chance events This version the Ching was the first complete English translation and had been published Wolffs father Kurt Wolff Pantheon Books 1950 The Ching commonly used for divination but for Cage became tool compose using chance compose piece music Cage would come with questions ask the Ching the book would then used much the same way used for divination For Cage this meant imitating nature its manner operation His lifelong interest sound itself culminated approach that yielded works which sounds were free from the composers will When hear what call music seems that someone talking And talking about his feelings about his ideas relationships But when hear traffic the sound traffichere Sixth Avenue for instanceI dont have the feeling that anyone talking have the feeling that sound acting And love the activity sound dont need sound talk Although Cage had used chance few earlier occasions most notably the third movement Concerto for Prepared Piano and Chamber Orchestra 195051 the Ching opened new possibilities this field for him The first results the new approach were Imaginary Landscape for radio receivers and Music Changes for piano The latter work was written for David Tudor whom Cage met through Feldmananother friendship that lasted until Cages death Tudor premiered most Cages works until the early 1960s when stopped performing the piano and concentrated composing music The Ching became Cages standard tool for composition used practically every work composed after 1951 Despite the fame Sonatas and Interludes earned him and the connections cultivated with American and European composers and musicians Cage was quite poor Although still had apartment 326 Monroe Street which occupied since around 1946 his financial situation 1951 worsened much that while working Music Changes prepared set instructions for Tudor how complete the piece the event his death Nevertheless Cage managed survive and maintained active artistic life giving lectures performances etc 195253 completed another mammoth projectthe Williams Mix piece tape music which Earle Brown helped put together Also 1952 Cage composed the piece that became his bestknown and most controversial creation 433 The score instructs the performer not play the instrument during the entire duration the piecefour minutes thirtythree secondsand meant perceived consisting the sounds the environment that the listeners hear while performed Cage conceived silent piece years earlier but was reluctant write down and indeed the premiere given Tudor August 1952 Woodstock New York caused uproar the audience The reaction 433 was just part the larger picture the whole was the adoption chance procedures that had disastrous consequences for Cages reputation The press which used react favorably earlier percussion and prepared piano music ignored his new works and many valuable friendships and connections were lost Pierre Boulez who used promote Cages work Europe was opposed Cages use chance and were other composers who came prominence during the 1950s Karlheinz Stockhausen and Iannis Xenakisnot citation given During this time Cage was also teaching the avantgarde Black Mountain College just outside Asheville North Carolina Cage taught the college the summers 1948 and 1952 and was residence the summer 1953 While Black Mountain College 1952 organized what has been called the first happening see discussion below the United States later titled Theatre Piece multilayered multimedia performance event staged the same day Cage conceived that that would greatly influence 1950s and 60s artistic practices addition Cage the participants included Cunningham and Tudor From 1953 onward Cage was busy composing music for modern dance particularly Cunninghams dances Cages partner adopted chance too out fascination for the movement the human body well developing new methods using chance series works referred The Ten Thousand Things the summer 1954 moved out New York and settled cooperative community Stony Point New York where his neighbors included David Tudor Richards Karen Karnes Stan VanDerBeek and Sari Dienes The composers financial situation gradually improved late 1954 and Tudor were able embark European tour From 1956 1961 Cage taught classes experimental composition The New School and from 1956 1958 also worked art director and designer typography Among his works completed during the last years the decade were Concert for Piano and Orchestra 195758 seminal work the history graphic notation and Variations 1958 Cage was affiliated with Wesleyan University and collaborated with members its Music Department from the 1950s until his death 1992 the University the philosopher poet and professor classics Norman Brown befriended Cage association that proved fruitful bothcitation needed 1960 the composer was appointed Fellow the faculty the Center for Advanced Studies now the Center for Humanities the Liberal Arts and Sciences Wesleyan where started teaching classes experimental music October 1961 Wesleyan University Press published Silence collection Cages lectures and writings wide variety subjects including the famous Lecture Nothing that was composed using complex time length scheme much like some Cages music Silence was Cages first book went publish five more Silence remained his most widely read and influential book the early 1960s Cage began his lifelong association with Peters Corporation Walter Hinrichsen the president the corporation offered Cage exclusive contract and instigated the publication catalog Cages works which appeared 1962 Edition Peters soon published large number scores Cage and this together with the publication Silence led much higher prominence for the composer than ever beforeone the positive consequences this was that 1965 Betty Freeman set annual grant for living expenses for Cage issued from 1965 his death the mid1960s Cage was receiving many commissions and requests for appearances that was unable fulfill them This was accompanied busy touring schedule consequently Cages compositional output from that decade was scant After the orchestral Atlas Eclipticalis 196162 work based star charts which was fully notated Cage gradually shifted his own words music not composition The score 000 completed 1962 originally comprised single sentence situation provided with maximum amplification perform disciplined action and the first performance the disciplined action was Cage writing that sentence The score Variations III 1962 abounds instructions the performers but makes references music musical instruments sounds Many the Variations and other 1960s pieces were fact happenings art form established Cage and his students late 1950s Cages Experimental Composition classes The New School have become legendary American source Fluxus international network artists composers and designers The majority his students had little background music Most were artists They included Jackson Mac Low Allan Kaprow Hansen George Brecht and Dick Higgins well many others Cage invited unofficially Famous pieces that resulted from the classes include George Brechts Time Table Music and Hansens Alice Denham Seconds set forth Cage happenings were theatrical events that abandon the traditional concept stageaudience and occur without sense definite duration Instead they are left chance They have minimal script with plot fact happening sonamed because occurs the present attempting arrest the concept passing time Cage believed that theater was the closest route integrating art and real life The term happenings was coined Allan Kaprow one his students who defined genre the late fifties Cage met Kaprow while mushroom hunt with George Segal and invited him join his class following these developments Cage was strongly influenced Antonin Artauds seminal treatise The Theatre and Its Double and the happenings this period can viewed forerunner the ensuing Fluxus movement October 1960 Mary Bauermeisters Cologne studio hosted joint concert Cage and the video artist Nam June Paik who the course his Etude for Piano cut off Cages tie and then washed his coperformers hair with shampoocitation needed 1967 Cages Year from Monday was first published Wesleyan University Press Cages parents died during the decade his father 1964 and his mother 1969 Cage had their ashes scattered Ramapo Mountains near Stony Point and asked for the same done him after his death Cages work from the sixties features some his largest and most ambitious not mention socially utopian pieces reflecting the mood the era yet also his absorption the writings both Marshall McLuhan the effects new media and Buckminster Fuller the power technology promote social change HPSCHD 1969 gargantuan and longrunning multimedia work made collaboration with Lejaren Hiller incorporated the mass superimposition seven harpsichords playing chancedetermined excerpts from the works Cage Hiller and potted history canonical classics with fiftytwo tapes computergenerated sounds 6400 slides designs many supplied NASA and shown from sixtyfour slide projectors with forty motionpicture films The piece was initially rendered fivehour performance the University Illinois 1969 which the audience arrived after the piece had begun and left before ended wandering freely around the auditorium the time for which they were therecitation needed Also 1969 Cage produced the first fully notated work years Cheap Imitation for piano The piece chancecontrolled reworking Erik Saties Socrate and both listeners and Cage himself noted openly sympathetic its source Although Cages affection for Saties music was wellknown was highly unusual for him compose personal work one which the composer present When asked about this apparent contradiction Cage replied Obviously Cheap Imitation lies outside what may seem necessary work general and thats disturbing the first disturbed Cages fondness for the piece resulted recordinga rare occurrence since Cage disliked making recordings his musicmade 1976 Overall Cheap Imitation marked major change Cages music turned again writing fully notated works for traditional instruments and tried out several new approaches such improvisation which previously discouraged but was able use works from the 1970s such Child Tree 1975 Cheap Imitation became the last work Cage performed public himself Arthritis had troubled Cage since 1960 and the early 1970s his hands were painfully swollen and rendered him unable perform Nevertheless still played Cheap Imitation during the 1970s before finally having give performing Preparing manuscripts also became difficult before published versions pieces were done Cages calligraphic script now manuscripts for publication had completed assistants Matters were complicated further David Tudors departure from performing which happened early 1970s Tudor decided concentrate composition instead and Cage for the first time two decades had start relying commissions from other performers and their respective abilities Such performers included Grete Sultan Paul Zukofsky Margaret Leng Tan and many others Aside from music Cage continued writing books prose and poetry mesostics was first published Wesleyan University Press 1973 January 1978 Cage was invited Kathan Brown Crown Point Press engage printmaking and Cage would produce series prints every year until his death these together with some late watercolors constitute the largest portion his extant visual art 1979 Cages Empty Words was first published Wesleyan University Press 1987 Cage completed piece called Two for flute and piano dedicated performers Roberto Fabbriciani and Carlo Neri The title referred the number performers needed the music consisted short notated fragments played any tempo within the indicated time constraints Cage went write some forty such pieces one the last being Eighty 1992 premiered Munich October 2011 usually employing variant the same technique together these works are known Number Pieces The process composition many the later Number Pieces was simple selection pitch range and pitches from that range using chance procedures the music has been linked Cages anarchic leanings One11 the eleventh piece for single performer completed early 1992 was Cages first and only foray into film Another new direction also taken 1987 was opera Cage produced five operas all sharing the same title Europera 198791 Europeras and require greater forces than III and which are chamber scale Already the course the 1980s Cages health worsened progressively suffered not only from arthritis but also from sciatica and arteriosclerosis suffered stroke that left the movement his left leg restricted and 1985 broke arm During this time Cage pursued macrobiotic diet Nevertheless ever since arthritis started plaguing him the composer was aware his age and biographer David Revill observed the fire which began incorporate his visual work 1985 not only the fire has set aside for longthe fire passionbut also fire transitoriness and fragility August 1992 while preparing evening tea for himself and Cunningham Cage suffered another stroke was taken Vincents Hospital Manhattan where died the morning August was According his wishes Cages body was cremated and the ashes scattered the Ramapo Mountains near Stony Point New York the same place where Cage scattered the ashes his parents years before The composers death occurred only weeks before celebration his 80th birthday organized Frankfurt the composer Walter Zimmermann and the musicologist Stefan Schaedler was due take place The event went ahead planned including performance the Concert for Piano and Orchestra David Tudor and Ensemble Modern Merce Cunningham lived another years dying natural causes July 2009 Cages first completed pieces are currently lost According the composer the earliest works were very short pieces for piano composed using complex mathematical procedures and lacking sensual appeal and expressive power Cage then started producing pieces improvising and writing down the results until Richard Buhlig stressed him the importance structure Most works from the early 1930s such Sonata for Clarinet 1933 and Composition for Voices 1934 are highly chromatic and betray Cages interest counterpoint Around the same time the composer also developed type tone row technique with 25note rows After studies with Schoenberg who never taught dodecaphony his students Cage developed another tone row technique which the row was split into short motives which would then repeated and transposed according set rules This approach was first used Two Pieces for Piano 1935 and then with modifications larger works such Metamorphosis and Five Songs both 1938 Soon after Cage started writing percussion music and music for modern dance started using technique that placed the rhythmic structure the piece into the foreground Imaginary Landscape 1939 there are four large sections and bars and each section divided into four subsections the first three which were all bars long First Construction Metal 1939 expands the concept there are five sections and units respectively Each unit contains bars and divided the same way bars bars bars etc Finally the musical content the piece based sixteen motives Such nested proportions Cage called them became regular feature his music throughout the 1940s The technique was elevated great complexity later pieces such Sonatas and Interludes for prepared piano 194648 which many proportions used noninteger numbers and for Sonata for example Flower song for voice and closed piano which two sets proportions are used simultaneously late 1940s Cage started developing further methods breaking away with traditional harmony For instance String Quartet Four Parts 1950 Cage first composed number gamuts chords with fixed instrumentation The piece progresses from one gamut another each instance the gamut was selected only based whether contains the note necessary for the melody and the rest the notes not form any directional harmony Concerto for prepared piano 195051 used system charts durations dynamics melodies etc from which Cage would choose using simple geometric patterns The last movement the concerto was step towards using chance procedures which Cage adopted soon afterwards chart system was also used along with nested proportions for the large piano work Music Changes 1951 only here material would selected from the charts using the Ching All Cages music since 1951 was composed using chance procedures most commonly using the Ching For example works from Music for Piano were based paper imperfections the imperfections themselves provided pitches coin tosses and Ching hexagram numbers were used determine the accidentals clefs and playing techniques whole series works was created applying chance operations the Ching star charts Atlas Eclipticalis 196162 and series etudes Etudes Australes 197475 Freeman Etudes 197790 and Etudes Boreales 1978 Cages etudes are all extremely difficult perform characteristic dictated Cages social and political views the difficulty would ensure that performance would show that the impossible not impossiblethis being Cages answer the notion that solving the worlds political and social problems impossible Cage described himself anarchist and was influenced Henry David Thoreau Another series works applied chance procedures preexisting music other composers Cheap Imitation 1969 based Erik Satie Some The Harmony Maine 1978 based Belcher and Hymns and Variations 1979 these works Cage would borrow the rhythmic structure the originals and fill with pitches determined through chance procedures just replace some the originals pitches Yet another series works the socalled Number Pieces all completed during the last five years the composers life make use time brackets the score consists short fragments with indications when start and end them from anywhere between 115 and 145 and anywhere from 200 230 Cages method using the Ching was far from simple randomization The procedures varied from composition composition and were usually complex For example the case Cheap Imitation the exact questions asked the Ching were these another example late music Cage Etudes Australes the compositional procedure involved placing transparent strip the star chart identifying the pitches from the chart transferring them paper then asking the Ching which these pitches were remain single and which should become parts aggregates chords and the aggregates were selected from table some 550 possible aggregates compiled beforehand Finally some Cages works particularly those completed during the 1960s feature instructions the performer rather than fully notated music The score Variations 1958 presents the performer with six transparent squares one with points various sizes five with five intersecting lines The performer combines the squares and uses lines and points coordinate system which the lines are axes various characteristics the sounds such lowest frequency simplest overtone structure etc Some Cages graphic scores Concert for Piano and Orchestra Fontana Mix both 1958 present the performer with similar difficulties Still other works from the same period consist just text instructions The score 000 1962 also known 433 consists single sentence situation provided with maximum amplification perform disciplined action The first performance had Cage write that sentence Musicircus 1967 simply invites the performers assemble and play together The first Musicircus featured multiple performers and groups large space who were all commence and stop playing two particular time periods with instructions when play individually groups within these two periods The result was mass superimposition many different musics top one another determined chance distribution producing event with specifically theatric feel Many Musicircuses have subsequently been held and continue occur even after Cages death The English National Opera became the first opera company hold Cage Musicircus March 2012 the London Coliseum The ENOs Musicircus featured artists including Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones and composer Michael Finnissy alongside ENO Music Director Edward Gardner the ENO Community Choir ENO Opera Works singers and collective professional and amateur talents performing the bars and front house Londons Coliseum Opera House This concept circus was remain important Cage throughout his life and featured strongly such pieces Roaratorio Irish circus Finnegans Wake 1979 manytiered rendering sound both his text Writing for the Second Time Through Finnegans Wake and traditional musical and field recordings made around Ireland The piece was based James Joyces famous novel Finnegans Wake which was one Cages favorite books and one from which derived texts for several more his works Since chance procedures were used Cage eliminate the composers and the performers likes and dislikes from music Cage disliked the concept improvisation which inevitably linked the performers preferences number works beginning the 1970s found ways incorporate improvisation Child Tree 1975 and Branches 1976 the performers are asked use certain species plants instruments for example the cactus The structure the pieces determined through the chance their choices the musical output the performers had knowledge the instruments Inlets 1977 the performers play large waterfilled conch shells carefully tipping the shell several times possible achieve bubble forming inside which produced sound Yet impossible predict when this would happen the performers had continue tipping the shells result the performance was dictated pure chance Although Cage started painting his youth gave order concentrate music instead His first mature visual project Not Wanting Say Anything About Marcel dates from 1969 The work comprises two lithographs and group what Cage called plexigrams silk screen printing plexiglas panels The panels and the lithographs all consist bits and pieces words different typefaces all governed chance operations From 1978 his death Cage worked Crown Point Press producing series prints every year The earliest project completed there was the etching Score Without Parts 1978 created from fully notated instructions and based various combinations drawings Henry David Thoreau This was followed the same year Seven Day Diary which Cage drew with his eyes closed but which conformed strict structure developed using chance operations Finally Thoreaus drawings informed the last works produced 1978 Signals Between 1979 and 1982 Cage produced number large series prints Changes and Disappearances 197980 the Surface 198082 and Dreau 1982 These were the last works which used engraving 1983 started using various unconventional materials such cotton batting foam etc and then used stones and fire Eninka Variations Ryoanji etc create his visual works 19881990 produced watercolors the Mountain Lake Workshop The only film Cage produced was one the Number Pieces One11 commissioned composer and film director Henning Lohner who worked with Cage produce and direct the 90minute monochrome film was completed only weeks before his death 1992 One11 consists entirely images chancedetermined play electric light premiered Cologne Germany September 1992 accompanied the live performance the orchestra piece 103 Throughout his adult life Cage was also active lecturer and writer Some his lectures were included several books published the first which was Silence Lectures and Writings 1961 Silence included not only simple lectures but also texts executed experimental layouts and works such Lecture Nothing 1949 which were composed rhythmic structures Subsequent books also featured different types content from lectures music poetryCages mesostics Cage was also avid amateur mycologist cofounded the New York Mycological Society with four friends and his mycology collection presently housed the Special Collections department the McHenry Library the University California Santa Cruz Cages prechance works particularly pieces from the late 1940s such Sonatas and Interludes earned critical acclaim the Sonatas were performed Carnegie Hall 1949 Cages adoption chance operations 1951 cost him number friendships and led numerous criticisms from fellow composers Adherents serialism such Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen dismissed indeterminate music Boulez who was once friendly terms with Cage criticized him for adoption philosophy tinged with Orientalism that masks basic weakness compositional technique Prominent critics serialism such the Greek composer Iannis Xenakis were similarly hostile towards Cage for Xenakis the adoption chance music was abuse language and abrogation composers function article teacher and critic Michael Steinberg Tradition and Responsibility criticized avantgarde music general The rise music that totally without social commitment also increases the separation between composer and public and represents still another form departure from tradition The cynicism with which this particular departure seems have been made perfectly symbolized John Cages account public lecture had given Later during the question period gave one six previously prepared answers regardless the question asked This was reflection engagement Zen While Cages famous silent piece 433 his Landscapes for dozen radio receivers may little interest music they are enormous importance historically representing the complete abdication the artists power Cages aesthetic position was criticized among others prominent writer and critic Douglas Kahn his 1999 book Noise Water Meat History Sound the Arts Kahn acknowledged the influence Cage had culture but noted that one the central effects Cages battery silencing techniques was silencing the social While much Cages work remains controversialcitation needed his influence countless composers artists and writers notablecitation needed After Cage introduced chanceclarification needed Boulez Stockhausen and Xenakis remained critical yet all adopted chance procedures some their works although much more restricted manner and Stockhausens piano writing his later Klavierstcke was influenced Cages Music Changes and David Tudor Other composers who adopted chance procedures their works included Witold Lutosawski Mauricio Kagel and many otherscitation needed Music which some the composition andor performance left chance was labelled aleatoric musica term popularized Pierre Boulezcitation needed Helmut Lachenmanns work was influenced Cages work with extended techniques Cages rhythmic structure experiments and his interest sound influenced number composers starting first with his close American associates Earle Brown Morton Feldman and Christian Wolff and other American composers such Monte Young Terry Riley Steve Reich and Philip Glass and then spreading Europecitation needed For example almost all composers the English experimental school acknowledge his influencecitation needed Michael Parsons
