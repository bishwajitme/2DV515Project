Musica universalis literally universal music also called Music the spheres Harmony the Spheres ancient philosophical concept that regards proportions the movements celestial bodiesthe Sun Moon and planetsas form musica the Medieval Latin term for music This music not usually thought literally audible but harmonic mathematical religious concept The idea continued appeal thinkers about music until the end the Renaissance influencing scholars many kinds including humanists Further scientific exploration has determined specific proportions some orbital motion described orbital resonance The discovery the precise relation between the pitch the musical note and the length the string that produces attributed PythagorasThe Music the Spheres incorporates the metaphysical principle that mathematical relationships express qualities tones energy which manifest numbers visual angles shapes and sounds all connected within pattern proportion Pythagoras first identified that the pitch musical note inverse proportion the length the string that produces and that intervals between harmonious sound frequencies form simple numerical ratios theory known the Harmony the Spheres Pythagoras proposed that the Sun Moon and planets all emit their own unique hum based their orbital revolution and that the quality life Earth reflects the tenor celestial sounds which are physically imperceptible the human ear Subsequently Plato described astronomy and music twinned studies sensual recognition astronomy for the eyes music for the ears and both requiring knowledge numerical proportions Aristotle criticised the notion that celestial bodies make sound moving the context his own cosmological model From all this clear that the theory that the movement the stars produces harmony that the sounds they make are concordant spite the grace and originality with which has been stated nevertheless untrue Some thinkers suppose that the motion bodies that size must produce noise since our earth the motion bodies far inferior size and speed movement has that effect Also when the sun and the moon they say and all the stars great number and size are moving with rapid motion how should they not produce sound immensely great Starting from this argument and from the observation that their speeds measured their distances are the same ratios musical concordances they assert that the sound given forth the circular movement the stars harmony Since however appears unaccountable that should not hear this music they explain this saying that the sound our ears from the very moment birth and thus indistinguishable from its contrary silence since sound and silence are discriminated mutual contrast What happens men then just what happens coppersmiths who are accustomed the noise the smithy that makes difference them But said before melodious and poetical the theory cannot true account the facts There not only the absurdity our hearing nothing the ground which they try remove but also the fact that effect other than sensitive produced upon Excessive noises know shatter the solid bodies even inanimate things the noise thunder for instance splits rocks and the strongest bodies But the moving bodies are great and the sound which penetrates proportionate their size that sound must needs reach intensity many times that thunder and the force its action must immense The three branches the Medieval concept musica were presented Boethius his book Musica According Max Heindels Rosicrucian writings the heavenly music the spheres heard the Region Concrete Thought the lower region the mental plane which ocean harmonycitation needed Musica universalis which had existed since the Greeks metaphysical concept was often taught quadrivium and this connection between music and astronomy intrigued Johannes Kepler and devoted much his time after publishing the Mysterium Cosmographicum Mystery the Cosmos looking over tables and trying fit the data what believed the true nature the cosmos 1619 Kepler published Harmonices Mundi literally Harmony the Worlds expanding the concepts introduced Mysterium and positing that musical intervals and harmonies describe the motions the six known planets the time believed that this harmony while inaudible could heard the soul and that gave very agreeable feeling bliss afforded him this music the imitation God Harmonices Kepler laid out argument for creator who had made explicit connection between geometry astronomy and music and that the planets were arranged intelligently Harmonices split into five books chapters The first and second books give brief discussion regular polyhedron and their congruences reiterating the idea introduced Mysterium that the five regular solids known about since antiquity define the orbits the planets and their distances from the sun Book three focuses defining musical harmonies including consonance and dissonance intervals including the problems just tuning their relations string length and what makes music pleasurable listen the fourth book Kepler presents metaphysical basis for this system along with arguments for why the harmony the worlds appeals the intellectual soul the same manner the harmony music appeals the human soul Here also uses the naturalness this harmony argument for heliocentrism book five Kepler describes detail the orbital motion the planets and how this motion nearly perfectly matches musical harmonies Finally after discussion astrology book five Kepler ends Harmonices describing his third law which states that for any planet the cube the semimajor axis its elliptical orbit proportional the square its orbital period the final book Harmonices Kepler explains how the ratio the maximum and minimum angular speeds each planet its speeds the perihelion and aphelion very nearly equivalent consonant musical interval Furthermore the ratios between these extreme speeds the planets compared against each other create even more mathematical harmonies These speeds explain the eccentricity the orbits the planets natural way that appealed Keplers religious beliefs heavenly creator While Kepler did believe that the harmony the worlds was inaudible related the motions the planets musical concepts book four Harmonices makes analogy between comparing the extreme speeds one planet and the extreme speeds multiple planets with the difference between monophonic and polyphonic music Because planets with larger eccentricities have greater variation speed they produce more notes Earths maximum and minimum speeds for example are ratio roughly that semitone whereas Venus orbit nearly circular and therefore only produces singular note Mars which has the largest eccentricity has the largest interval minor tenth ratio This range well the relative speeds between the planets led Kepler conclude that the Solar System was composed two basses Saturn and Jupiter tenor Mars two altos Venus and Earth and soprano Mercury which had sung perfect concord the beginning time and could potentially arrange themselves again was certain the link between musical harmonies and the harmonies the heavens and believed that man the imitator the Creator had emulated the polyphony the heavens enjoy the continuous duration the time the world fraction hour Kepler was convinced creator that was convinced the existence this harmony despite number inaccuracies present Harmonices Many the ratios differed error greater than simple measurement error from the true value for the interval and the ratio between Mars and Jupiters angular velocities does not create consonant interval though every other combination planets does Kepler brushed aside this problem making the argument with the math support that because these elliptical paths had fit into the regular solids described Mysterium the values for both the dimensions the solids and the angular speeds would have differ from the ideal values compensate This change also had the benefit helping Kepler retroactively explain why the regular solids encompassing each planet were slightly imperfectKepler was convinced that the geometrical things have provided the Creator with the model for decorating the whole world and wanted further explored the aspects the natural world specifically being involved with astronomical and astrological concepts music When Kepler published Harmonices Mundi Kepler was held liable dispute with Robert Fludd who also published his own harmonic theory the time kepler the celestial physics the spheres were seen geometrically spatial regions that consisted each planetary orbit rather than its physical form The connection between music mathematics and astronomy had profound impact history resulted musics inclusion the Quadrivium the medieval curriculum that included arithmetic geometry music and astronomy and along with the Trivium grammar logicand rhetoric made the seven liberal arts which are still the basis for higher education today small number recent compositions either make reference are based the concepts Musica Universalis Harmony the Spheres Among these are Music the Spheres Mike Oldfield the Moody Blues The Earth Sings album The Receiving End Sirens Music the Spheres Ian Brown and Bjrks single Cosmogony included her 2011 album Biophilia Earlier the 1910s Danish composer Rued Langgaard composed pioneering orchestral work titled Music the Spheres Music the Spheres was also the title chosen for the musical foundation the videogame Destiny and was composed Martin ODonnell Michael Salvatori and Paul McCartney Paul Hindemith wrote Opera 1957 and Symphony using the same music called Die Harmonie der Welt based upon the life the Astronomer Johannes Kepler 15711630
