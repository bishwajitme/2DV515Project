Gestalt psychology gestaltism tlt tlt stlt stlt from German Gestalt shape form philosophy mind the Berlin School experimental psychology Gestalt psychology attempt understand the laws behind the ability acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions apparently chaotic world The central principle gestalt psychology that the mind forms global whole with selforganizing tendencies This principle maintains that when the human mind perceptual system forms percept gestalt the whole has reality its own independent the parts The original famous phrase Gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka the whole something else than the sum its parts often incorrectly translated The whole greater than the sum its parts and thus used when explaining gestalt theory and further incorrectly applied systems theory Koffka did not like the translation firmly corrected students who replaced other with greater This not principle addition said The whole has independent existence the study perception Gestalt psychologists stipulate that perceptions are the products complex interactions among various stimuli Contrary the behaviorist approach focusing stimulus and response gestalt psychologists sought understand the organization cognitive processes Carlson and Heth 2010 Our brain capable generating whole forms particularly with respect the visual recognition global figures instead just collections simpler and unrelated elements points lines curves etc psychology gestaltism often opposed structuralism Gestalt theory proposed allows for the deconstruction the whole situation into its elements The concept gestalt was first introduced philosophy and psychology 1890 Christian von Ehrenfels member the School Brentano The idea gestalt has its roots theories David Hume Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Immanuel Kant David Hartley and Ernst Mach Max Wertheimers unique contribution was insist that the gestalt perceptually primary defining the parts was composed from rather than being secondary quality that emerges from those parts von Ehrenfelss earlier GestaltQualitt had beencitation needed Both von Ehrenfels and Edmund Husserl seem have been inspired Machs work Beitrge zur Analyse der Empfindungen Contributions the Analysis Sensations 1886 formulating their very similar concepts gestalt and figural moment respectively the philosophical foundations these ideas see Foundations Gestalt Theory Smith 1988 Early 20th century theorists such Kurt Koffka Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang Khler students Carl Stumpf saw objects perceived within environment according all their elements taken together global construct This gestalt whole form approach sought define principles perceptionseemingly innate mental laws that determined the way objects were perceived based the here and now and the way things are seen Images can divided into figure ground The question what perceived first glance the figure front the background These laws took several forms such the grouping similar proximate objects together within this global process Although gestalt has been criticized for being merely descriptive has formed the basis much further research into the perception patterns and objects Carlson 2000 and research into behavior thinking problem solving and psychopathology The founders Gestalt therapy Fritz and Laura Perls had worked with Kurt Goldstein neurologist who had applied principles Gestalt psychology the functioning the organism Laura Perls had been Gestalt psychologist before she became psychoanalyst and before she began developing Gestalt therapy together with Fritz Perls The extent which Gestalt psychology influenced Gestalt therapy disputed however any case not identical with Gestalt psychology the one hand Laura Perls preferred not use the term Gestalt name the emerging new therapy because she thought that the gestalt psychologists would object the other hand Fritz and Laura Perls clearly adopted some Goldsteins work Thus though recognizing the historical connection and the influence most gestalt psychologists emphasize that gestalt therapy not form gestalt psychology Mary Henle noted her presidential address Division the meeting the American Psychological Association 1975 What Perls has done has been take few terms from Gestalt psychology stretch their meaning beyond recognition mix them with notionsoften unclear and often incompatiblefrom the depth psychologies existentialism and common sense and has called the whole mixture gestalt therapy His work has substantive relation scientific Gestalt psychology use his own language Fritz Perls has done his thing whatever not Gestalt psychology With her analysis however she restricts herself explicitly only three Perls books from 1969 and 1972 leaving out Perls earlier work and Gestalt therapy general psychotherapy method There have been clinical applications Gestalt psychology the psychotherapeutic field long before Perlsian Gestalt therapy group psychoanalysis Foulkes Adlerian individual psychology Gestalt psychologists psychotherapy like Erwin Levy Abraham Luchins Gestalt psychologically oriented psychoanalysts Italy Canestrari and others and there have been newer developments foremost Europe Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy The school gestalt practiced series theoretical and methodological principles that attempted redefine the approach psychological research This contrast investigations developed the beginning the 20th century based traditional scientific methodology which divided the object study into set elements that could analyzed separately with the objective reducing the complexity this object The theoretical principles are the following Based the principles above the following methodological principles are defined the 1940s and 1950s laboratory research neurology and what became known cybernetics the mechanism frogs eyes indicate that perception gestalts particular gestalts motion perhaps more primitive and fundamental than seeing such The key principles gestalt systems are emergence reification multistability and invariance This demonstrated the dog picture which depicts Dalmatian dog sniffing the ground the shade overhanging trees The dog not recognized first identifying its parts feet ears nose tail etc and then inferring the dog from those component parts Instead the dog appears whole all once Gestalt theory does not have explanation for how this perception dog appears Reification the constructive generative aspect perception which the experienced percept contains more explicit spatial information than the sensory stimulus which based For instance triangle perceived picture though triangle there pictures and the eye recognizes disparate shapes belonging single shape complete threedimensional shape seen where actuality such thing drawn Reification can explained progress the study illusory contours which are treated the visual system real contours Multistability multistable perception the tendency ambiguous perceptual experiences pop back and forth unstably between two more alternative interpretations This seen for example the Necker cube and Rubins FigureVase illusion shown here Other examples include the threelegged blivet and artist Eschers artwork and the appearance flashing marquee lights moving first one direction and then suddenly the other Again gestalt does not explain how images appear multistable only that they Invariance the property perception whereby simple geometrical objects are recognized independent rotation translation and scale well several other variations such elastic deformations different lighting and different component features For example the objects the figure are all immediately recognized the same basic shape which are immediately distinguishable from the forms They are even recognized despite perspective and elastic deformations and when depicted using different graphic elements Computational theories vision such those David Marr have provided alternate explanations how perceived objects are classified Emergence reification multistability and invariance are not necessarily separable modules model individually but they could different aspects single unified dynamic mechanism The fundamental principle gestalt perception the law prgnanzde the German language pithiness which says that tend order our experience manner that regular orderly symmetrical and simple Gestalt psychologists attempt discover refinements the law prgnanz and this involves writing down laws that hypothetically allow predict the interpretation sensation what are often called gestalt laws major aspect Gestalt psychology that implies that the mind understands external stimuli whole rather than the sum their parts The wholes are structured and organized using grouping laws The various laws are called laws principles depending the paper where they appearbut for simplicitys sake this article uses the term laws These laws deal with the sensory modality vision However there are analogous laws for other sensory modalities including auditory tactile gustatory and olfactory Bregman The visual Gestalt principles grouping were introduced Wertheimer 1923 Through the 1930s and 40s Wertheimer Kohler and Koffka formulated many the laws grouping through the study visual perception Some the central criticisms Gestaltism are based the preference Gestaltists are deemed have for theory over data and lack quantitative research supporting Gestalt ideas This not necessarily fair criticism highlighted recent collection quantitative research Gestalt perception Other important criticisms concern the lack definition and support for the many physiological assumptions made gestaltists and lack theoretical coherence modern Gestalt psychology some scholarly communities such cognitive psychology and computational neuroscience gestalt theories perception are criticized for being descriptive rather than explanatory nature For this reason they are viewed some redundant uninformative For example Bruce Green Georgeson conclude the following regarding gestalt theorys influence the study visual perception The physiological theory the gestaltists has fallen the wayside leaving with set descriptive principles but without model perceptual processing Indeed some their laws perceptual organisation today sound vague and inadequate What meant good simple shape for example Gestalt psychologists find important think problems whole Max Wertheimer considered thinking happen two ways productive and reproductive Productive thinking solving problem with insight This quick insightful unplanned response situations and environmental interaction Reproductive thinking solving problem with previous experiences and what already known 19451959 This very common thinking For example when person given several segments information heshe deliberately examines the relationships among its parts analyzes their purpose concept and totality heshe reaches the aha moment using what already known Understanding this case happens intentionally reproductive thinking Another gestalt psychologist Perkins believes insight deals with three processes Views going against the gestalt psychology are Gestalt psychology should not confused with the gestalt therapy Fritz Perls which only peripherally linked gestalt psychology strictly gestalt psychologybased therapeutic method Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy developed the German gestalt psychologist and psychotherapist HansJrgen Walter and his colleagues Germany Austria Gerhard Stemberger and colleagues and Switzerland Other countries especially Italy have seen similar developments Fuzzytrace theory dual process model memory and reasoning was also derived from Gestalt psychology Fuzzytrace theory posits that encode information into two separate traces verbatim and gist Information stored verbatim exact memory for detail the individual parts pattern for example while information stored gist semantic and conceptual what perceive the pattern The effects seen Gestalt psychology can attributed the way encode information gist The gestalt laws are used user interface design The laws similarity and proximity can for example used guides for placing radio buttons They may also used designing computers and software for more intuitive human use Examples include the design and layout desktops shortcuts rows and columns example the Gestalt movement effect both process and result music sequence People are able recognise sequence perhaps six seven notes despite them being transposed into different tuning key Similarities between Gestalt phenomena and quantum mechanics have been pointed out among others chemist Anton Amann who commented that similarities between Gestalt perception and quantum mechanics are level parable yet may give useful insight nonetheless Physicist Elio Conte and coworkers have proposed abstract mathematical models describe the time dynamics cognitive associations with mathematical tools borrowed from quantum mechanics and has discussed psychology experiments this context similar approach has been suggested physicists David Bohm Basil Hiley and philosopher Paavo Pylkknen with the notion that mind and matter both emerge from implicate order The models involve noncommutative mathematics such models account for situations which the outcome two measurements performed one after the other can depend the order which they are performeda pertinent feature for psychological processes experiment performed conscious person may influence the outcome subsequent experiment changing the state mind that person
