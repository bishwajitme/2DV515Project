Knight eyewitness report the reallife shipwreck the Sea Venture 1609 the island Bermuda while sailing towards Virginia considered most critics one Shakespeares primary sources because certain verbal plot and thematic similarities Although not published until 1625 Stracheys report one several describing the incident dated July 1610 and critics say that Shakespeare must have seen manuscript sometime during that year Chambers identified the True Reportory Shakespeares main authority for The Tempest and the modern Arden editors say Shakespeare surely drew Strachey and Montaigne for specific passages the play There has been however some scepticism about the alleged influence Strachey the play Kenneth Muir argued that although there little doubt that Shakespeare had read William Stracheys True Reportory and other accounts the extent the verbal echoes the Bermuda pamphlets has think been exaggerated There hardly shipwreck history fiction which does not mention splitting which the ship not lightened its cargo which the passengers not give themselves for lost which north winds are not sharp and which one gets shore clinging wreckage and goes say that Stracheys account the shipwreck blended with memories Saint Pauls which too not hair perished and with Erasmus colloquy Another Sea Venture survivor Sylvester Jourdain also published account Discovery The Barmudas dated

interpreted and told London near the time The Tempest was written The Tempest may take its overall structure from traditional Italian commedia dellarte which sometimes featured magus and his daughter their supernatural attendants and number rustics The commedia often featured clown known Arlecchino his predecessor Zanni and his partner Brighella who bear striking resemblance Stephano and Trinculo lecherous Neapolitan hunchback who corresponds Caliban and the clever and beautiful Isabella whose wealthy and manipulative father Pantalone constantly seeks suitor for her thus mirroring the

The Tempest presents relatively few textual problems comparison with many Shakespeares other plays First published the First Folio December 1623 the play first the volume leading the section comedies The play has more stage directions than any Shakespeares other plays though they appear have been written for readers instead actors Scholars infer from this that the editors the volume John Heminges and Henry Condell included the directions aid readers and they were not necessarily Shakespeares Scholars have also wondered about the masque Act which some think was interpolated afterthought possibly added for the wedding Princess Elizabeth and Frederick 1613 However other scholars see this unlikely arguing that taking the masque out the play creates more problems than solves Our revels now are ended These our actorsAs foretold you were all spirits andAre melted into air into thin airAnd like the baseless fabric this visionThe cloudcapped towers the gorgeous palacesThe solemn temples the great globe itselfYea all which inherit shall dissolveAnd like this insubstantial pageant fadedLeave not rack behind are such stuffAs dreams are made and our little lifeIs rounded with sleep The Tempest explicitly concerned with its own nature play frequently drawing links between Prosperos art and theatrical illusion the shipwreck was spectacle that Ariel performed while Antonio and Sebastian are cast troop act Prospero may even refer the Globe Theatre when describes the whole world illusion the great globe shall dissolve like this insubstantial pageant Ariel frequently disguises himself figures from Classical mythology for example nymph harpy and Ceres acting the latter masque and antimasque that Prospero creates Early critics such Thomas Campbell 1838 saw this constant allusion the theatre indication that Prospero was meant represent Shakespeare the characters renunciation magic thus signals Shakespeares farewell the stage This theory persists among later critics and remains solidly within the critical canon Protestant England where Shakespeare wrote The Tempest magic was taboo Not all magic however was considered evilcitation needed Several thinkers took more rational approach the study the supernatural with the determination discover the workings unusual phenomena The German Henricus Cornelius Agrippa was one such thinker who published Occulta Philosophia 1531 1533 his observations divine magic Agrippas work influenced John Dee Englishman and student supernatural phenomena When King James took the throne Dee found himself under attack for his beliefs but was able defend himself successfully explaining the divine nature his profession However died disgrace 1608 Shakespeare also careful make the distinction that Prospero presents himself rational magician not occultist does this providing contrast him Sycorax Sycorax said have worshipped the devil and been full earthy and abhored commands She was unable control Ariel who was too delicate for such dark tasks Prosperos rational goodness enables him control Ariel where Sycorax can only trap him tree Sycoraxs magic frequently described destructive and terrible where Prosperos said wondrous

the monster from the although the theory dismissed obsolete that imagined future and was also dismissed James Phillips 1964 Prospero exiled island with symbol his baser vegetative nature Caliban and his higher sensitive supernatural side Ariel Some productions have seen the same actor play all three roles making them symbols the conflict within fully actualised awakened Prospero that between crude selfish physicality and higher mystical side According this theoryone manyfor long Prospero battling with these qualities and lost books banished from Milan the play finds its conclusion both

fare thou well says setting Ariel free Abandoning magic and acknowledging the brutal potential his nature allowed return his rightful place Duke subject agreement from the audience you from crimes would pardond let your indulgence set free The story draws heavily the tradition the romance fictitious narrative set far away from ordinary life Romances were typically based around themes such the supernatural wandering exploration and discovery They were often set coastal regions and typically featured exotic fantastical locations and themes transgression and redemption loss and retrieval exile and reunion result while The Tempest was originally listed comedy the First Folio Shakespeares plays subsequent editors have chosen give the more specific label Shakespearean romance Like the other romances the play was influenced the thennew genre tragicomedy introduced John Fletcher the first decade the 17th century and developed the Beaumont and Fletcher collaborations well the explosion development the courtly masque form such Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones the same time The Tempest differs from Shakespeares other plays its observation stricter more organised neoclassical style The clearest indication this Shakespeares respect for the three unities the play the Unities Time Place and Action Shakespeares other plays rarely respected the three unities taking place separate locations miles apart and over several days even years The plays events unfold real time before the audience Prospero even declaring the last act that everything has happened more less three hours All action unified into one basic plot Prosperos struggle regain his dukedom also confined one place fictional island which many scholars agree meant located the Mediterranean Sea Another reading suggests that takes place the New World some parts read like records English and Spanish conquest the Americas Still others argue that the Island can represent any land that has been colonised Shakespeares day much the world was still being colonized European merchants and settlers and stories were coming back from the Americas with myths about the Cannibals the Caribbean faraway Edens and distant tropical Utopias With the character Caliban whose name almost anagram Cannibal and also resembles Cariban the term then used for natives the West Indies Shakespeare may offering indepth discussion into the morality colonialism Different views this are found the play with examples including Gonzalos Utopia Prosperos enslavement Caliban and Calibans subsequent resentment Caliban also shown one the most natural characters the play being very much touch with the natural world and modern audiences have come view him far nobler than his two Old World friends Stephano and Trinculo although the original intent the author may have been different There evidence that Shakespeare drew Montaignes essay Cannibalswhich discusses the values societies insulated from European influenceswhile writing The Tempest Beginning about 1950 with the publication Psychology Colonization Octave Mannoni The Tempest was viewed more and more through the lens postcolonial theory This new way looking the text explored the effect the coloniser Prospero the colonised Ariel and Caliban Although Ariel often overlooked these debates favour the more intriguing Caliban nonetheless essential component them The French writer Aim Csaire his play Une Tempte sets The Tempest Haiti portraying Ariel mulatto who unlike the more rebellious Caliban feels that negotiation and partnership the way freedom from the colonisers Fernandez Retamar sets his version the play Cuba and portrays Ariel wealthy Cuban comparison the lowerclass Caliban who also must choose between rebellion negotiation Although scholars have suggested that his dialogue with Caliban Act two Scene one contains hints future alliance between the two when Prospero leaves Ariel generally viewed scholars the good servant comparison with the conniving Calibana view which Shakespeares audience may well have sharednot citation given See discussion Ariel used some postcolonial writers symbol their efforts overcome the effects colonisation their culture For example Michelle Cliff Jamaican author has said that she tries combine Caliban and Ariel within herself create way writing that represents her culture better Such use Ariel postcolonial thought far from uncommon the spirit even the namesake scholarly journal covering postcolonial criticism The Tempest has only one female character Miranda Other women such Calibans mother Sycorax Mirandas mother and Alonsos daughter Claribel are only mentioned Because the small role women play the story comparison other Shakespeare plays The Tempest has attracted much feminist criticism Miranda typically viewed being completely deprived freedom her father Her only duty his eyes remain chaste Ann Thompson argues that Miranda manner typical women colonial atmosphere has completely internalised the patriarchal order things thinking herself subordinate her father The lessprominent women mentioned the play are subordinated well they are only described through the men the play Most what said about Sycorax for example said Prospero Further Stephen Orgel notes that Prospero has never met Sycorax all learned about her learned from Ariel According Orgel Prosperos suspicion women makes him unreliable source information Orgel suggests that sceptical female virtue general citing his ambiguous remark about his wifes fidelityHowever certain goddesses such Juno Ceres Iris and sea nymphs are one scene the play record exists performance The Tempest November 1611 the Kings Men before James and the English royal court Whitehall Palace Hallowmas night The play

Palatinate the Rhine There further public performance recorded prior the Restoration but his 1669 preface the DrydenDavenant version John Dryden states that The Tempest had been performed the Blackfriars Theatre Careful consideration stage directions within the play supports this strongly suggesting that the play was written with Blackfriars Theatre rather than the Globe Theatre mind
