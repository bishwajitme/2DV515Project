harpsichord musical instrument played means keyboard which activates row levers that turn trigger mechanism that plucks one more strings with small plectrum The term denotes the whole family similar pluckedkeyboard instruments including the smaller virginals muselar and spinet The harpsichord was widely used Renaissance and Baroque music During the late 18th century with the rise the piano gradually disappeared from the musical scene the 20th century made resurgence being used historically informed performances older music new compositions and certain styles popular music Harpsichords vary size and shape but all have the same basic mechanism The player depresses key that rocks over pivot the middle its length The other end the key lifts jack long strip wood that holds small plectrum wedgeshaped piece quill often made plastic today which plucks the string When the player releases the key the far end returns its rest position and the jack falls back the plectrum mounted tongue that can swivel backwards away from the string passes the string without plucking again the key reaches its rest position felt damper atop the jack stops the strings vibrations These basic principles are explained detail below Each string wound around tuning pin normally the end the string closer the player When rotated with wrench tuning hammer the tuning pin adjusts the tension that the string sounds the correct pitch Tuning pins are held tightly holes drilled the pinblock wrestplank oblong hardwood plank Proceeding from the tuning pin string next passes over the nut sharp edge that made hardwood and normally attached the wrestplank The section the string beyond the nut forms its vibrating length which plucked and creates sound the other end its vibrating length the string passes over the bridge another sharp edge made hardwood with the nut the horizontal position the string along the bridge determined vertical metal pin inserted into the bridge against which the string rests The bridge itself rests soundboard thin panel wood usually made spruce fir orin some Italian harpsichordscypress The soundboard efficiently transduces the vibrations the strings into vibrations the air without soundboard the strings would produce only very feeble sound string attached its far end loop hitchpin that secures the case While many harpsichords have one string per note more elaborate harpsichords can have two more strings for each note When there are multiple strings for each note these additional strings are called choirs strings This provides two advantages the ability vary volume and ability vary tonal quality Volume increased when the mechanism the instrument set the player see below that the press single key plucks more than one string Tonal quality can varied two ways First different choirs strings can designed have distinct tonal qualities usually having one set strings plucked closer the nut which emphasizes the higher harmonics and produces nasal sound quality The mechanism the instrument called stops following the use the term pipe organs permits the player select one choir the other Second having one key pluck two strings once changes not just volume but also tonal quality for instance when two strings tuned the same pitch are plucked simultaneously the note not just louder but also richer and more complex particularly vivid effect obtained when the strings plucked simultaneously are octave apart This normally heard the ear not two pitches but one the sound the higher string blended with that the lower one and the ear hears the lower pitch enriched tonal quality the additional strength the upper harmonics the note sounded the higher string When describing harpsichord customary specify its choirs strings often called its disposition Strings eight foot pitch sound the normal expected pitch strings four foot pitch sound octave higher Harpsichords occasionally include sixteenfoot choir one octave lower than eightfoot twofoot choir two octaves higher quite rare When there are multiple choirs strings the player often able control which choirs sound This usually done having set jacks for each choir and mechanism for turning off each set often moving the upper register through which the jacks slide sideways short distance that their plectra miss the strings simpler instruments this done manually moving the registers but the harpsichord evolved builders invented levers knee levers and pedal mechanisms make easier change registration Harpsichords with more than one keyboard this usually means two keyboards stacked one top the other stepwise fashion with pipe organs provide flexibility selecting which strings play since each manual can set control the plucking different set strings addition such harpsichords often have mechanism the coupler that couples manuals together that single manual plays both sets strings The most flexible system the French shove coupler which the lower manual slides forward and backward the backward position dogs attached the upper surface the lower manual engage the lower surface the upper manuals keys Depending choice keyboard and coupler position the player can select any the sets jacks labeled figure and all three The English dogleg jack system also used Baroque Flanders does not require coupler The jacks labeled Figure have dogleg shape that permits either keyboard play the player wishes play the upper from the upper manual only and not from the lower manual stop handle disengages the jacks labeled and engages instead alternative row jacks called lute stop not shown the Figure lute stop used imitate the gentle sound plucked lute The use multiple manuals harpsichord was not originally provided for the flexibility choosing which strings would sound but rather for transposition the instrument play different keys see History the harpsichord The case holds position all the important structural members pinblock soundboard hitchpins keyboard and the jack action usually includes solid bottom and also internal bracing maintain its form without warping under the tension the strings Cases vary greatly weight and sturdiness Italian harpsichords are often light construction heavier construction found the later Flemish instruments and those derived from them The case also gives the harpsichord its external appearance and protects the instrument large harpsichord sense piece furniture stands alone legs and may styled the manner other furniture its place and period Early Italian instruments the other hand were light construction that they were treated rather like violin kept for storage protective outer case and played after taking out its case and placing table Such tables were often quite high until the late 18th century people usually played standing Eventually harpsichords came built with just single case though intermediate stage also existed the false innerouter which for purely aesthetic reasons was built look the outer case contained inner one the old style Even after harpsichords became selfencased objects they often were supported separate stands and some modern harpsichords have separate legs for improved portability Many harpsichords have lid that can raised cover for the keyboard and stand for music Harpsichords have been decorated great many different ways with plain buff paint some Flemish instruments with paper printed with patterns with leather velvet coverings with chinoiserie occasionally with highly elaborate painted artwork modern usage harpsichord can mean any member the family instruments More often though specifically denotes grandpianoshaped instrument with roughly triangular case accommodating long bass strings the left and short treble strings the right The characteristic profile such harpsichord more elongated than modern piano with sharper curve than the bentsidenot citation given The virginal smaller and simpler rectangular form the harpsichord having only one string per note the strings run parallel the keyboard which the long side the case spinet harpsichord with the strings set angle usually about degrees the keyboard The strings are too close together for the jacks fit between them Instead the strings are arranged pairs and the jacks are the larger gaps between the pairs The two jacks each gap face opposite directions and each plucks string adjacent the gap The English diarist Samuel Pepys mentions his tryangle several times This was not the percussion instrument that call triangle today rather was name for octavepitched spinets which were triangular shape clavicytherium harpsichord with the soundboard and strings mounted vertically facing the player the same spacesaving principle upright piano clavicytherium the jacks move horizontally without the assistance gravity that clavicytherium actions are more complex than those other harpsichords Ottavini are small spinets virginals fourfoot pitch Harpsichords octave pitch were more common the early Renaissance but lessened popularity later However the ottavino remained very popular domestic instrument Italy until the 19th century the Low Countries ottavino was commonly paired with virginals encased small cubby under the soundboard the larger instrument The ottavino could removed and placed top the virginal making effect double manual instrument These are sometimes called motherandchild double virginals The archicembalo built the 16th century had unusual keyboard layout designed accommodate variant tuning systems demanded compositional practice and theoretical experimentation More common were instruments with split sharps also designed accommodate the tuning systems the time The folding harpsichord was instrument that could folded for travel Pedal Harpsichord Occasionally harpsichords were built which included another set sets strings underneath and operated pedals which pluck the lowest keys the harpsichord Although there are known extant pedal harpsichords from the 18th century before from Adlung 1758 the lower set usually strings built like ordinary harpsichord but with extent two octaves only The jacks are similar but they will benefit from being arranged back back since the two bass octaves take much space four ordinary harpsichord Prior 1980 when Keith Hill introduced his design for pedal harpsichord most pedal harpsichords were built based the designs extant pedal pianos from the 19th century which the instrument wide the pedalboard While these were mostly intended practice instruments for organists few pieces are believed have been written specifically for the pedal harpsichord However the set pedals can augment the sound from any piece performed the instrument demonstrated several albums Power Biggs the whole earlier harpsichords have smaller ranges than later ones although there are many exceptions The largest harpsichords have range just over five octaves and the smallest have under four Usually the shortest keyboards were given extended range the bass with short octave The traditional pitch range for 5octave instrument F1F6 FFf Tuning pitch often taken A4415Hz roughly semitone lower than the modern standard concert pitch A4440Hz accepted exception for French baroque repertoire which often performed with a392Hz approximately semitone lower again See JeanPhilippe Rameaus Treatise Harmony 1722 Dover Publications Book One chapter five for insight into French baroque tuning Since most these semitones are absolutely necessary the tuning organs and other similar instruments the following chromatic system has been drawn Tuning instrument nowadays usually starts with setting historically would commence from Some modern instruments are built with keyboards that can shift sideways allowing the player align the mechanism with strings either A415Hz A440Hz tuning other than equal temperament used the instrument requires retuning once the keyboard shifted The harpsichord was most likely invented the late Middle Ages the 16th century harpsichord makers Italy were making lightweight instruments with low string tension different approach was taken the Southern Netherlands starting the late 16th century notably the Ruckers family Their harpsichords used heavier construction and produced more powerful and distinctive tone They included the first harpsichords with two keyboards used for transposition The Flemish instruments served the model for 18th century harpsichord construction other nations France the double keyboards were adapted control different choirs strings making more musically flexible instrument Instruments from the peak the French tradition makers such the Blanchet family and Pascal Taskin are among the most widely admired all harpsichords and are frequently used models for the construction modern instruments England the Kirkman and Shudi firms produced sophisticated harpsichords great power and sonority German builders extended the sound repertoire the instrument adding sixteen foot and two foot choirs these instruments have recently served models for modern builders the late 18th century the harpsichord was supplanted the piano and almost disappeared from view for most the 19th century exception was its continued use opera for accompanying recitative but the piano sometimes displaced even there Twentieth century efforts revive the harpsichord began with instruments that used piano technology with heavy strings and metal frames Starting the middle the 20th century ideas about harpsichord making underwent major change when builders such Frank Hubbard William Dowd and Martin Skowroneck sought reestablish the building traditions the Baroque period Harpsichords this type historically informed building practice dominate the current scene The great bulk the standard repertoire for the harpsichord was written during its first historical flowering the Renaissance and Baroque eras The first music written specifically for solo harpsichord was published around the early 16th century Composers who wrote solo harpsichord music were numerous during the whole Baroque era European countries including Italy Germany England and France Solo harpsichord compositions included dance suites fantasias and fugues Among the most famous composers who wrote for the harpsichord were the members English virginal school the late Renaissance notably William Byrd 15401623 France great number highly characteristic solo works were created and compiled into four books ordres Franois Couperin 16681733 Domenico Scarlatti 16851757 began his career Italy but wrote most his solo harpsichord works Spain his most famous work his series 555 harpsichord sonatas Perhaps the most celebrated composers who wrote for the harpsichord were Georg Friedrich Hndel 16851759 who composed numerous suites for harpsichord and especially Bach 16851750 whose solo works for instance the WellTempered Clavier and the Goldberg Variations continue performed very widely often the piano Bach was also pioneer the harpsichord concerto both works designated such and the harpsichord part his Fifth Brandenburg Concerto Two the most prominent composers the Classical era Joseph Haydn 17321809 and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 17561791 wrote harpsichord music For both the instrument featured the earlier period their careers and although they had come into contact with the piano later they nonetheless continued play the harpsichord and clavichord for the rest their lives Mozart was noted have played his second last keyboard concerto the Coronation the harpsichordcitation needed Through the 19th century the harpsichord was almost completely supplanted the piano the 20th century composers returned the instrument they sought out variation the sounds available them Under the influence Arnold Dolmetsch the harpsichordists Violet GordonWoodhouse 18721951 and France Wanda Landowska 18791959 were the forefront the instruments renaissance Concertos for the instrument were written Francis Poulenc the Concert champtre 192728 and Manuel Falla Elliott Carters Double Concerto scored for harpsichord
