since have the feeling this the way orchestra should sound the way should play had never heard the beauty this calmness the sound that sort glissando the manner vibrato the string sound the blend woodwinds with the strings with the brass the balance the brass combination with the percussion contributing together the overall sonority the orchestra For this impression was definitive and now would like anticipate point and tell you this this sound 1897 the same today The VPOs sound has been attributed part the VPOs instruments and part its playing styles Instruments least part the characteristic sound the Vienna Philharmonic has been attributed the use instruments that differ from those used other major orchestras the other hand least two instruments instrument families are like those other orchestras According the Vienna Philharmonics website the flute largely the same the conventional Bhm flute which widely used all over the world However did not replace the wooden flute Vienna until the 1920s Also the Viennese string sound should not attributed unique attributes the instruments according the VPO which writes its website There can doubt that the Viennese string

recordings the musicologist Robert Philip has documented some changes how VPO players used vibrato during the mid20th century although also notes differences between the VPO and other orchestras the era was typical the era the pre1945 flutes show very little vibrato recordings until after World War even the long solo Mahlers Das Lied von der Erde the flautist under Bruno Walter 1936 plays almost without vibrato except few long notes with delicate mediumspeed vibrato but the late 1940s the flautists had adopted gentle mediumspeed vibrato The oboes before the 1940s show little vibrato but the late 1940s the principal oboist had adopted very delicate fast vibrato but uses very sparingly The cor anglais notes even the late 1940s still played without any vibrato The bassoonists show virtually bassoon vibrato the 1950s The Vienna Philharmonic website states that today with the flute all wind and brass instruments the Viennese classics vibrato used very sparingly Philips notes that 1931 the Vienna Philharmonic strings were reported use uniform bowing which was still unusual Britain for portamento sliding audibly from one note another prominent effect among prewar string players the VPO strings sliding the early 1930s sounds more deliberately expressive and less matter routine than that British orchestras This partly because the firmer dynamic shaping the melodic line partly because the warmer and fuller string tone Further hears strong evidence free approach portamento that different players shifting different points within the same phrase which shows was standard
