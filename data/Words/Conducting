Conducting the art directing musical performance such orchestral choral concert has been defined the art directing the simultaneous performance several players singers the use gesture The primary duties the conductor are interpret the score way which reflects the specific indications that score set the tempo ensure correct entries ensemble members and shape the phrasing where appropriate Conductors communicate with their musicians primarily through hand gestures usually with the aid baton and may use other gestures signals such eye contact conductor usually supplements their direction with verbal instructions their musicians rehearsal The conductor typically stands raised podium with large music stand for the full score which contains the musical notation for all the instruments voices Since the mid19th century most conductors have not played instrument when conducting although earlier periods classical music history leading ensemble while playing instrument was common Baroque music from the 1600s the 1750s the group would typically led the harpsichordist first violinist see concertmaster approach that modern times has been revived several music directors for music from this period Conducting while playing piano synthesizer may also done with musical theatre pit orchestras Communication typically nonverbal during performance this strictly the case art music but jazz big bands large pop ensembles there may occasional spoken instructions such count However rehearsals frequent interruptions allow the conductor give verbal directions how the music should played sung Conductors act guides the orchestras choirs they conduct They choose the works performed and study their scores which they may make certain adjustments such tempo articulation phrasing repetitions sections work out their interpretation and relay their vision the performers They may also attend organizational matters such scheduling rehearsals planning concert season hearing auditions and selecting members and promoting their ensemble the media Orchestras choirs concert bands and other sizable musical ensembles such big bands are usually led conductors The principal conductor orchestra opera company sometimes referred music director chief conductor the German words Kapellmeister Dirigent Conductors choirs choruses are sometimes referred choral director chorus master choirmaster particularly for choirs associated with orchestra Conductors concert bands military bands marching bands and other bands may hold the title band director bandmaster drum major Respected senior conductors are sometimes referred the Italian word maestro master one who has mastered the art early form conducting cheironomy the use hand gestures indicate melodic shape This has been practiced least far back the Middle Ages the Christian church the person giving these symbols held staff signify his role and seems that music became rhythmically more complex the staff was moved and down indicate the beat acting early form baton the 17th century other devices indicate the passing time came into use Rolled sheets paper smaller sticks and unadorned hands are all shown pictures from this period The large staff was responsible for the death JeanBaptiste Lully who injured his foot with one while conducting Deum for the Kings recovery from illness The wound became gangrenous and Lully refused amputation whereupon the gangrene spread his leg and died two months later instrumental music throughout the 18th century member the ensemble usually acted the conductor This was sometimes the concertmaster who could use his bow baton lutenist who would move the neck his instrument time with the beat was common conduct from the harpsichord pieces that had basso continuo part opera performances there were sometimes two conductors the keyboard player was charge the singers and the principal violinist leader was charge the orchestra Fri Sep 1791 Vienna Mozarts opera Die Zauberflte The Magic Flute premiered the Theater auf der Wieden also known the Wiednertheater with Mozart himself conducting the orchestra according documents and publicity posters from that time 1798 Joseph Haydn conducted the premiere Creation with his hands and baton while KapellmeisterWeigl sat the fortepiano the early 19th century 1820 became the norm have dedicated conductor who did not also play instrument during the performance While some orchestras protested the introduction the conductor since they were used having concertmaster keyboard player act leader eventually the role conductor was established The size the usual orchestra expanded during this period and the use baton became more common was easier see than bare hands rolledup paper Among the earliest notable conductors were Louis Spohr Carl Maria von Weber LouisAntoine Jullien and Felix Mendelssohn all whom were also composers Mendelssohn claimed have been the first conductor utilize wooden baton keep time practice still generally use the 2010s Prominent conductors who did not not use baton include Pierre Boulez Kurt Masur James Conlon Yuri Temirkanov Leopold Stokowski Vasily Safonov Eugene Ormandy for period and Dimitri Mitropoulos The composers Hector Berlioz and Richard Wagner attained greatness conductors and they wrote two the earliest essays dedicated the subject Berlioz considered the first virtuoso conductor Wagner was largely responsible for shaping the conductors role one who imposes his own view piece onto the performance rather than one who just responsible for ensuring entries are made the right time and that there unified beat Predecessors who focused conducting include Franois Habeneck who founded the Orchestre Socit des concerts Conservatoire 1828 though Berlioz was later alarmed Habenecks loose standards rehearsal Pianist and composer Franz Liszt was also conductor Wagners onetime champion Hans von Blow 18301894 was particularly celebrated conductor although also maintained his initial career pianist instrument which was regarded among the greatest performers was prized piano student Franz Liszt whose daughter Cosima married although she was abandon him for Wagner Liszt was major figure the history conducting who attained remarkable performances Blow raised the technical standards conducting unprecedented level through such innovations separate detailed rehearsals different sections the orchestra sectional rehearsal his posts head sequentially the Bavarian State Opera Meiningen Court Orchestra and Berlin Philharmonic brought level nuance and subtlety orchestral performance previously heard only solo instrumental playing and doing made profound impression young artists like Richard Strauss who the age served his assistant and Felix Weingartner who came disapprove his interpretations but was deeply impressed his orchestral standards Composer Gustav Mahler was also noted conductor The next generation conductors brought technical standards new levels perhaps most notable was the Hungarianborn Arthur Nikisch 18551922 who succeeded Blow music director the Berlin Philharmonic 1895 had previously served head the Leipzig Opera Boston Symphony Orchestra and Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and was serve music director the London Symphony Orchestra Nikisch premiered important works Anton Bruckner and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky who greatly admired his work Johannes Brahms after hearing him conduct his Fourth Symphony said was quite exemplary its impossible hear any better Nikisch took the London Symphony Orchestra tour through the United States April 1912 the first American tour European orchestra also made one the earliest recordings complete symphony the Beethoven Fifth with the Berlin Philharmonic November 1913 Nikisch was also the first conductor have his art captured film alas silently The film confirms reports that made particularly mesmerizing use eye contact and expression communicate with orchestra such later conductors Fritz Reiner stated that this aspect his technique had strong influence their own Conductors the generations after Nikisch often left extensive recorded evidence their arts Two particularly influential and widely recorded figures are often treated somewhat inaccurately interpretive antipodes They were the Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini 18671957 and the German conductor Wilhelm Furtwngler 18861954 Toscanini played orchestras under Giuseppe Verdi and made his debut conducting Aida 1886 filling the last minute for indisposed conductor this day regarded such authorities James Levine the greatest all Verdi conductors But Toscaninis repertory was wide and was his interpretations the German symphonists Beethoven and Brahms that was particularly renowned and influential favoring stricter and faster tempi than conductor like Blow before him Wagner Still his style shows more inflection than his reputation may suggest and was particularly gifted revealing detail and getting orchestras play singing manner Furtwngler whom many regard the greatest interpreter Wagner although Toscanini was also admired this composer and Bruckner conducted Beethoven and Brahms with good deal inflection tempo but generally manner that revealed the structure and direction the music particularly clearly was accomplished composer well performer and disciple the theorist Heinrich Schenker who emphasized concern for underlying longrange harmonic tensions and resolutions piece strength Furtwnglers conducting Along with his interest the largescale Furtwngler also shaped the details the piece particularly compelling and expressive manner The two men had very different techniques Toscaninis was Italianate with long large baton and clear beats often not using his left hand Furtwngler beat time with less apparent precision because wanted more rounded sound although myth that his technique was vague many musicians have attested that was easy follow his own way any event their examples illustrate larger point about conducting technique the first half the 20th century was not standardized Great and influential conductors the middle 20th century like Leopold Stokowski 18821977 Otto Klemperer 18851973 Herbert von Karajan 19081989 and Leonard Bernstein 19181990 incidentally the first American conductor attain greatness and international fame had widely varied techniques Karajan and Bernstein formed another apparent antipode the 1960s80s Karajan music director the Berlin Philharmonic 195589 and Bernstein for part that period music director the New York Philharmonic 195769 and later frequent guest conductor Europe Karajans technique was highly controlled and eventually conducted with his eyes often closed Bernsteins technique was demonstrative with highly expressive facial gestures and hand and body movements Karajan could conduct for hours without moving his feet while Bernstein was known times leap into the air great climax the music director the Berlin Philharmonic Karajan cultivated warm blended beauty tone which has sometimes been criticized too uniformly applied contrast Bernsteins only appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic 1979 performing Mahlers Symphony tried get the orchestra produce ugly tone certain passage which believed suited the expressive meaning the music the first horn player refused and finally agreed let understudy play instead himself Both Karajan and Bernstein made extensive use advances media convey their art but tellingly different ways Bernstein hosted major primetime national television series educate and reach out children and the public large about classical music Karajan made series films late his life but them did not talk Both made numerous recordings but their attitudes toward recording differed Karajan frequently made new studio recordings take advantage advances recording technique which fascinated him played role setting the specifications the compact disc but Bernstein his postNew York days came insist for the most part live concert recordings believing that musicmaking did not come life studio without audience the last third the 20th century conducting technique particularly with the right hand and the baton became increasingly standardized Conductors like Willem Mengelberg Amsterdam until the end World War had had extensive rehearsal time mold orchestras very precisely and thus could have idiosyncratic techniques modern conductors who spend less time with any given orchestra must get results with much less rehearsal time more standardized technique allows communication much more rapid Nonetheless conductors techniques still show great deal variety particularly with the use the left hand facial and eye expression and body language Women conductors were almost unheard the ranks leading orchestral conductors through most the 19th and 20th centuries but today artists like Hortense von Gelminide Marin Alsop and Simone Young are seen conducting leading orchestras Alsop was appointed music director the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra 2007 the first woman ever appointed head major orchestra and also the Orquestra Sinfnica Estado Paulo 2012 and Alsop was the first woman conduct the last night The Proms Young scored similar firsts when she became head the Hamburg State Opera and Philharmoniker Hamburg 2005 she also the first woman conductor record the Ring Cycle Richard Wagner The Guardian called conducting one the last glass ceilings the music industry 2013 article stated that France out 574 concerts only were conducted women and women conducted the National Opra Paris Bachtrack reported that list the worlds 150 top conductors that year only five were women While Mexico has produced several major international conductors Alondra Parra has become the first Mexicanborn woman attain distinction the profession Similarly Asian origin has become unremarkable because the international successes conductors from the Far East such Seiji Ozawa who was the Boston Symphony Orchestras music director from 1973 until 2002 after holding similar posts San Francisco and Toronto and MyungWhun Chung who has held major posts Germany and France and now bringing the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra international attention There still underrepresentation artists black origin the conducting profession but there have been notable exceptions such Henry Lewis Dean Dixon James DePreist Paul Freeman and Michael Morgan For more information black conductors see Black conductors According 2004 article The Guardian black conductors are rare the classical music world and even symphony orchestras unusual see more than one two black musicians Conducting means communicating artistic directions performers during performance Although there are many formal rules how conduct correctly others are subjective and wide variety different conducting styles exist depending upon the training and sophistication the conductor The primary responsibilities the conductor are unify performers set the tempo execute clear preparations and beats listen critically and shape the sound the ensemble and control the interpretation and pacing the music Communication nonverbal during performance however rehearsal frequent interruptions allow directions how the music should played During rehearsals the conductor may stop the playing piece request changes the phrasing request change the timbre certain section amateur orchestras the rehearsals are often stopped draw the musicians attentions performance errors transposition mistakes Conducting requires understanding the elements musical expression tempo dynamics articulation and the ability communicate them effectively ensemble The ability communicate nuances phrasing and expression through gestures also beneficial Conducting gestures are preferably prepared beforehand the conductor while studying the score but may sometimes spontaneous distinction sometimes made between orchestral conducting and choral conducting Typically orchestral conductors use baton more often than choral conductors The grip the baton varies from conductor conductor the beginning piece music the conductor raises his hands hand only uses single hand indicate that the piece about begin This signal for the orchestra members ready their instruments played for the choristers ready and watching The conductor then looks the different sections the orchestra winds strings etc choir ensure that all the orchestra members are ready play and choir members are ready some choral works the conductor may signal pianist organist play note chord that the choir members can determine their starting notes Then the conductor gives one more preparatory beats commence the music The preparatory beat before the orchestra choir begins the upbeat The beat the music typically indicated with the conductors right hand with without baton The hand traces shape the air every bar measure depending the time signature indicating each beat with change from downward upward motion The images show the most common beat patterns seen from the conductors point viewcitation needed The downbeat indicates the first beat the bar and the upbeat indicates the beat before the first note the piece and the last beat the bar The instant which the beat occurs called the ictus plural icts ictuses and usually indicated sudden though not necessarily large click the wrist change baton direction some instances ictus also used refer horizontal plane which all the ictuses are physically located such the top music stand where baton tapped each ictus The gesture leading the ictus called the preparation and the continuous flow steady beats called the takt the German word for bar measure and beat the tempo slow slowing the time signature compound conductor will sometimes indicate subdivisions the beats The conductor can this adding smaller movement the same direction the movement for the beat that belongs Changes the tempo are indicated changing the speed the beat carry out and control rallentando slowing down the pace the music conductor may introduce beat subdivisions While some conductors use both hands indicate the beat with the left hand mirroring the right formal education discourages such approach The second hand can used for cueing the entrances individual players sections and aid indications dynamics phrasing expression and other elements During instrumental solo section opera orchestra during vocalists unaccompanied solo some conductors stop counting out all the subdivisions and simply tap the baton down once per bar aid performers who are counting bars rests There difference between the textbook definition where the ictus downbeat occurs and the actual performance practice professional orchestras With abrupt loud sforzando chord professional orchestra will often play slightly after the striking the ictus point the baton stroke Dynamics are indicated various ways The dynamic may communicated the size the conducting movements larger shapes representing louder sounds Changes dynamic may signalled with the hand that not being used indicate the beat upward motion usually palmup indicates crescendo downward motion usually palmdown indicates diminuendo Changing the size conducting movements frequently results changes the character the music depending upon the circumstances Dynamics can finetuned using various gestures showing ones palm the performers leaning away from them may demonstrate decrease volume adjust the overall balance the various instruments voices these signals can combined directed toward particular section performer The indication entries when performer section should begin playing perhaps after long period rests called cueing cue must forecast with certainty the exact moment the coming ictus that all the players singers affected the cue can begin playing simultaneously Cueing most important for cases where performer section has not been playing for lengthy time Cueing also helpful the case pedal point with string players when section has been playing the pedal point for lengthy period cue important indicate when they should change new note Cueing achieved engaging the players before their entry looking them and executing clear preparation gesture often directed toward the specific players inhalation which may may not semiaudible sniff from the conductor common element the cueing technique some conductors Mere eye contact look the general direction the players may sufficient many instances when more than one section the ensemble enters the same time Larger musical events may warrant the use larger more emphatic cue designed encourage emotion and energy Articulation may indicated the character the ictus ranging from short and sharp for staccato long and fluid for legato Many conductors change the tension the hands strained muscles and rigid movements may correspond marcato while relaxed hands and soft movements may correspond legato espressivo Phrasing may indicated wide overhead arcs smooth hand motion either forwards sidetoside held note often indicated hand held flat with palm The end note called cutoff release may indicated circular motion the closing the palm the pinching finger and thumb release usually preceded preparation and concluded with complete stillness Conductors aim maintain eye contact with the ensemble much possible encouraging eye contact return and increasing the dialogue between playerssingers and conductor Facial expressions may also important demonstrate the character the music encourage the players some cases such where there has been little rehearsal time prepare piece conductor may discreetly indicate how the bars music will beat immediately before the start the movement holding their fingers front their chest only the performers can see For example piece that the conductor will beat two two ictus points beats per bar were the conductor would hold two fingers front his chest most cases there short pause between movements symphony concerto dance suite This brief pause gives orchestra choir members time turn the pages their part and ready themselves for the start the next movement String players may apply rosin wipe sweat off their hands with handkerchief Reed players may take this time change new reed some cases woodwind brass players will use the pause switch different instrument from trumpet cornet from clarinet clarinet the conductor wishes immediately begin one movement after another for musical reasons this called attacca The conductor will instruct the orchestra members and choristers write the term their parts that they will ready immediately the next movement The roles conductor vary great deal between different conducting positions and different ensembles some cases conductor will also the musical director the symphony choosing the program for the entire season including concerts guest conductors concerto soloists pop concerts and senior conductor may attend some all the auditions for new members the orchestra ensure that the candidates have the playing style and tone that the conductor prefers and that candidates meet the highest performance standards Some choral conductors are hired prepare choir for several weeks which will subsequently directed another conductor The choral conductor usually acknowledged for their preparatory work the concert program Some conductors may have significant public relations role giving interviews the local news channel and appearing television talk shows promote the upcoming season particular concerts the other hand conductor hired guest conduct single concert may only have the responsibility rehearsing the orchestra for several pieces and conducting one two concerts While handful conductors have become wellknown celebrities such Leonard Bernstein most are only known within the classical music scene Classical choral and instrumental conducting have established comprehensive systems instruction and training Aspiring conductors can study colleges conservatories and universities Conservatories which are the standard musical training system France and Quebec Canada provide lessons and amateur conducting experience Universities offer range conducting programs including courses conducting part bachelors degrees small number Master Music degrees conducting and even smaller number Doctor Musical Arts degrees conducting addition there are variety other training programs such classical summer camps and training festivals which give students the opportunity conduct wide range music Aspiring conductors need obtain broad education about the history music including the major periods classical music and regarding music theory Many conductors learn play keyboard instrument such the piano the pipe organ skill that helps them able analyze symphonies and try out their interpretations before they have access orchestra conduct Many conductors get experience playing orchestra singing choir experience which gives them good insights into how orchestras and choirs are conducted and rehearsed 2014 orchestra conductors typically hold masters degree music and choir conductors the typically hold bachelors degree music Bachelors degrees referred BMus are fouryear programs that include conducting lessons amateur orchestra experience and sequence courses music history music theory and liberal arts courses English literature which give the student more wellrounded education Students not usually specialize conducting the BMus stage instead they usually develop general music skills such singing playing orchestral instrument performing choir playing orchestra and playing keyboard instrument such the piano the organ Another topic that conducting students study the languages used Classical music opera Orchestral conductors are expected able rehearse and lead choirs works for orchestra and choir such orchestral conductors need know the major languages used choral writing including French Italian and Latin among others and they must understand the correct diction these languages choral singing context The opposite also true choral conductor will expected rehearse and lead string orchestra full orchestra when performing works for choir and orchestra such choral conductor needs know how rehearse and lead instrument sections Master music degrees Mmus conducting consist private conducting lessons ensemble experience coaching and graduate courses music history and music theory along with one two conducted concerts Masters degree music referred MMus often the required minimum credential for people who wish become professor conducting Doctor Musical Arts referred DMA DMA DMusA AMusD degrees conducting provide opportunity for advanced study the highest artistic and pedagogical level requiring usually additional credit hours beyond masters degree which about credits beyond bachelors degree For this reason admission highly selective Examinations music history music theory ear trainingdictation and entrance examination and conducting audition are required Students perform number conducted concerts including combination lectureconducted concert with accompanying doctoral dissertation advanced coursework Students must typically maintain minimum average DMA conducting terminal degree and such qualifies the holder teach colleges universities and conservatories addition academic study another part the training pathway for many conductors conducting amateur orchestras such youth orchestras school orchestras and community orchestras small number conductors become professionals without formal training conducting These individuals often have achieved renown instrumental vocal performers and they have often undertaken great deal training their area expertise instrumental performance singing Another way that small number conductors become professionals without formal training conducting learning the job conducting amateur orchestras school orchestras and community orchestras the equivalent choral ensembles The average salary conductors the 2014 was 48180 growth rate forecast for conducting jobs from 2014 2024 slower than average growth
