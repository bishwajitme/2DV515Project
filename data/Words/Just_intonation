music just intonation sometimes abbreviated pure intonation the tuning musical intervals small whole number ratios frequencies Any interval tuned this way called just interval Just intervals and chords are aggregates harmonic series partials and may seen sharing lower implied fundamental For example tone with frequency 300 and another with frequency 200 are both multiples 100Hz 100 and 100 respectively Their interval therefore aggregate the second and third partials the harmonic series implied fundamental frequency 100Hz Without context just intonation typically refers 5limit just intonation where ratios only contain powers the prime numbers and American composer Ben Johnston proposed the term extended just intonation for composition involving ratios that contain prime numbers beyond etc Just intonation may contrasted and compared with standard 12tone equal temperament which dominates Western instruments fixed pitch piano organ and default MIDI tuning electronic keyboards equal temperament all intervals are defined integer power the basic step the equaltempered semitone whose ratio 2121displaystyle sqrt1221 100 cents two notes separated the same number steps share the same frequency ratio Except for the doubling frequencies one more octaves all intervals are fact irrational and may not expressed ratio whole numbers Just intonation the other hand suggests many microtonally differentiated sizes intervals which stem from different regions the harmonic series For example the major third has three standard tunings 7limit just intonation 43508 cents 8164 40782 cents and 38631 cents Pythagorean tuning the first tuning system theoretically elaborated system which all tones are generated using ratios prime numbers and well their powers The most basic these the ratio itself called the perfect fifth Pythagorean tuning this sense spiral cycling fifths The justly tuned perfect fifth with the ratio 70196 cents wide however not equivalent the modern equaltempered perfect fifth the piano with ratio 2712displaystyle 271270000 cents wide Rather larger than the equaltempered fifth the small interval twelfth the Pythagorean comma 53144152428812displaystyle sqrt12frac 531441524288 196 cents stack justly tuned perfect fifths therefore does not arrive the same pitch class began with This new pitch class one full Pythagorean comma higher than the starting pitch class demonstrating how continuous spiral Pythagorean perfect fifths will generate infinite collection unique pitch classes within frequency range Pythagorean tuning the most consonant intervals are the perfect fifth and its inversion the perfect fourth The Pythagorean major third 8164 and minor third 3227 are complex and comparably much more dissonant than the smoother sounding intervals with simpler ratios obtained from tuning system than introduces powers the prime number The 5limit major and minor thirds have ratios and respectively The difference between the Pythagorean major third and the 5limit major third sometimes referred the Ptolemaic major third known the syntonic comma and has the ratio 8180 2151 cents During the second century Claudius Ptolemy described 5limit diatonic scale his influential text music theory Harmonics which called tense diatonic Given ratios string lengths 120 112 100 and Ptolemy quantified the consonant tuning what would today called the major scale beginning and ending the mediant 1615 109 1615 and 109 The guqin has musical scale based harmonic overtone positions The dots its soundboard indicate the harmonic positions The prominent notes given scale may tuned that their frequencies form relatively small whole number ratios The 5limit diatonic major scale tuned such way that major triads the tonic subdominant and dominant are tuned the proportion 456 and minor triads the mediant and submediant are tuned the proportion 101215 Because the two sizes wholetone major wholetone and 109 minor wholetone the supertonic must microtonally lowered syntonic comma form pure minor triad 5limit diatonic major scale Ptolemys intense diatonic scale For justly tuned melodic minor scale the mediant tuned and the submediant tuned Harmonic minor would include tuning for the subtonic There are several ways create just tuning the twelve tone scale Pythagorean tuning can produce twelvetone scale but does involving ratios very large numbers corresponding natural harmonics very high the harmonic series that not occur widely physical phenomena This tuning uses ratios involving only powers and creating sequence just fifths fourths follows The ratios are computed with respect the base note Starting from they are obtained moving six steps around the circle fifths the left and six the right Each step consists multiplication the previous pitch descending fifth ascending fifth their inversions Between the enharmonic notes both ends this sequence pitch ratio 312 219 531441 524288 about cents known the Pythagorean comma produce twelve tone scale one them arbitrarily discarded The twelve remaining notes are repeated increasing decreasing their frequencies power the size one more octaves build scales with multiple octaves such the keyboard piano drawback Pythagorean tuning that one the twelve fifths this scale badly tuned and hence unusable the wolf fifth either discarded discarded This twelve tone scale fairly close equal temperament but does not offer much advantage for tonal harmony because only the perfect intervals fourth fifth and octave are simple enough sound pure Major thirds for instance receive the rather unstable interval 8164 sharp the preferred 8180 ratio The primary reason for its use that extremely easy tune its building block the perfect fifth the simplest and consequently the most consonant interval after the octave and unison Pythagorean tuning may regarded threelimit tuning system because the ratios are obtained using only powers where most twelve tone scale can also created compounding harmonics the fifth Namely multiplying the frequency given reference note the base note powers combination them This method called fivelimit tuning build such twelve tone scale may start constructing table containing fifteen pitches The factors listed the first row and column are powers and respectively Colors indicate couples enharmonic notes with almost identical pitch The ratios are all expressed relative the centre this diagram the base note for this scale They are computed two steps Note that the powers used the second step may interpreted ascending descending octaves For instance multiplying the frequency note means increasing octaves Moreover each row the table may considered sequence fifths ascending the right and each column sequence major thirds ascending upward For instance the first row the table there ascending fifth from and and another one followed descending octave from This suggests alternative but equivalent method for computing the same ratios For instance one can obtain starting from moving one cell the left and one upward the table which means descending fifth and ascending major third Since this below one needs move octave end within the desired range ratios from 12tone scale obtained removing one note for each couple enharmonic notes This can done least three ways which have common the removal according convention which was valid even for Cbased Pythagorean and quartercomma meantone scales Note that diminished fifth close half octave above the tonic which disharmonic interval also its ratio has the largest values its numerator and denominator all tones the scale which make least harmonious all reasons avoid This only one possible strategy fivelimit tuning consists discarding the first column the table labeled The resulting 12tone scale shown below The table above uses only low powers and build the base ratios However can easily extended using higher positive and negative powers the same numbers such 125 127 scale with even more pitches can obtained combining these base ratios fivelimit tuning Indian music the just diatonic scale described above used though there are different possibilities for instance for the sixth pitch Dha and further modifications may made all pitches excepting and Some accounts Indian intonation system cite given Shrutis According some musicians one has scale given pitches and ten addition the tonic Shadja and the pure fifth Pancham are inviolate Where have two ratios for given letter name have difference 8180 cents which known the syntonic comma One can see the symmetry looking from the tonic then the octave This just one example explaining 22ruti scale tones There are many different explanations Some fixed just intonation scales and systems such the diatonic scale above produce wolf intervals The above scale allows minor tone occur next semitone which produces the awkward ratio 3227 for and still worse minor tone next fourth giving 4027 for Moving down 109 alleviates these difficulties but creates new ones becomes 2720 and becomes 2716 One can have more frets guitar handle both with respect and 109 with respect that can played while can still played and 109 are less than 153 octave apart mechanical and performance considerations have made this approach extremely rare And the problem how tune chords such CEGAD left unresolved for instance could below making above making 109 but not both the same time one the fourths the chord will have outoftune wolf interval However the frets may removed entirelythis unfortunately makes intune fingering many chords exceedingly difficult due the construction and mechanics the human handand the tuning most complex chords just intonation generally ambiguous Some composers deliberately use these wolf intervals and other dissonant intervals way expand the tone color palette piece music For example the extended piano pieces The WellTuned Piano LaMonte Young and The Harp New Albion Terry Riley use combination very consonant and dissonant intervals for musical effect Revelation Michael Harrison goes even further and uses the tempo beat patterns produced some dissonant intervals integral part several movements For many instruments tuned just intonation one cannot change keys without retuning the instrument For instance piano tuned just intonation intervals and minimum wolf intervals for the key then only one other key typically Eflat can have the same intervals and many the keys have very dissonant and unpleasant sound This makes modulation within piece playing repertoire pieces different keys impractical impossible Synthesizers have proven valuable tool for composers wanting experiment with just intonation They can easily retuned with microtuner Many commercial synthesizers provide the ability use builtin just intonation scales create them manually Wendy Carlos used system her 1986 album Beauty the Beast where one electronic keyboard was used play the notes and another used instantly set the root note which all intervals were tuned which allowed for modulation her 1987 lecture album Secrets Synthesis there are audible examples the difference sound between equal temperament and just intonation The human voice among the most pitchflexible instruments common use Pitch can varied with restraints and adjusted the midst performance without needing retune Although the explicit use just intonation fell out favour concurrently with the increasing use instrumental accompaniment with its attendant constraints pitch most cappella ensembles naturally tend toward just intonation because the comfort its stability Barbershop quartets are good example this The unfretted stringed instruments from the violin family the violin the viola the cello and the double bass are quite flexible the way pitches can adjusted Stringed instruments that are not playing with fixed pitch instruments tend adjust the pitch key notes such thirds and leading tones that the pitches differ from equal temperament Composers often impose limit how complex the ratios may become For example composer who chooses write 7limit just intonation will not employ ratios that use powers prime numbers larger than Under this scheme ratios like 117 and 136 would not permitted because and cannot expressed powers those prime numbers and Though just intonation its simplest form 5limit may seem suggest necessarily tonal logic need not the case Some music Kraig Grady and Daniel James Wolf uses just intonation scales designed Erv Wilson explicitly for consonant form atonality and many Ben Johnstons early works like the Sonata for Microtonal Piano and String Quartet use serialism achieve more atonal result Alternatively composers such Monte Young Ben Johnston James Tenney Marc Sabat Wolfgang von Schweinitz Chiyoko Szlavnics Catherine Lamb Kristofer Svensson and Thomas Nicholson have sought new kind tonality and harmony one based the perception and experience sound which not only allows for the more familiar consonant structures but also extends them beyond the 5limit into nuanced and diverse network relationships between tones Yuri Landman devised just intonation musical scale from atonal prepared guitar playing technique based adding third bridge under the strings When this bridge positioned nodal positions the guitar strings harmonic series the volume the instrument increases and the overtone becomes clear having consonant relation the complementary opposed string part creating harmonic multiphonic tone Originally system notation describe scales was devised Hauptmann and modified Helmholtz 1877 which Pythagorean notes are started with and subscript numbers are added indicating how many commas 8180 syntonic comma lower For example the Pythagorean major third Playhelpinfo while the just major third CE1 Playhelpinfo similar system was devised Carl Eitz and used Barbour 1951 which Pythagorean notes are started with and positive negative superscript numbers are added indicating how many commas 8180 syntonic comma adjust For example the Pythagorean major third CE0 while the just major third CE1 While these systems allow precise indication intervals and pitches print more recently some composers have been developing notation methods for Just Intonation using the conventional fiveline staff James Tenney amongst others preferred combine ratios with cents deviations from the equal tempered pitches indicated legend directly the score allowing performers readily use electronic tuning devices desired Beginning the 1960s Ben Johnston had proposed alternative approach redefining the understanding conventional symbols the seven white notes the sharps and flats and adding further accidentals each designed extend the notation into higher prime limits His notation begins with the 16thcentury Italian definitions intervals and continues from there Johnstons method based diatonic Major scale tuned which the interval between above and above one syntonic comma less than Pythagorean perfect fifth write perfect fifth Johnston introduces pair symbols representing this comma and Thus series perfect fifths beginning with would proceed The three conventional white notes are tuned Ptolemaic major thirds above respectively Johnston introduces new symbols for the septimal undecimal tridecimal and further primenumber extensions create accidental based exact notation for what has named Extended Just Intonation For example the Pythagorean major third while the just major third 20002004 Marc Sabat and Wolfgang von Schweinitz worked Berlin develop different accidentalbased method the Extended HelmholtzEllis Pitch Notation Following the method notation suggested Helmholtz his classic the Sensations Tone Physiological Basis for the Theory Music incorporating Ellis invention cents and continuing Johnstons step into Extended Sabat and Schweinitz consider each prime dimension harmonic space represented unique symbol particular they take the conventional flats naturals and sharps Pythagorean series perfect fifths Thus series perfect fifths beginning with proceeds CGDAEBF and For higher primes additional signs have been designed facilitate quick estimation pitches cents indications may added downward deviations below and upward deviations above the respective accidental The convention used that the cents written refer the tempered pitch implied the flat natural sharp sign and the note name complete legend and fonts for the notation see samples are open source and available from Plainsound Music Edition For example the Pythagorean major third while the just major third One the great advantagesvague such notation systems that they allow the natural harmonic
