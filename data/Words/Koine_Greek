Koine Greek kni kne kne kini also known Alexandrian dialect common Attic Hellenistic Biblical Greek was the common supraregional form Greek spoken and written during the Hellenistic period the Roman Empire and the early Byzantine Empire late antiquitycitation needed evolved from the spread Greek following the conquests Alexander the Great the fourth century and served the lingua franca much the Mediterranean region and the Middle East during the following centuries was based mainly Attic and related Ionic speech forms with various admixtures brought about through dialect levelling with other varieties Koine Greek included styles ranging from more conservative literary forms the spoken vernaculars the time the dominant language the Byzantine Empire developed further into Medieval Greek which then turned into Modern Greek Literary Koine was the medium much postclassical Greek literary and scholarly writing such the works Plutarch and Polybius Koine also the language the Christian New Testament the Septuagint the 3rdcentury Greek translation the Hebrew Bible and most early Christian theological writing the Church Fathers this context Koine Greek also known Biblical New Testament ecclesiastical patristic Greek The Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius also wrote his private thoughts Koine Greek work that now known The Meditations continues used the liturgical language services the Greek Orthodox Church The Englishlanguage name Koine derives from the Koine Greek term koin dilektos the common dialect The Greek word koin itself means common The word pronounced kne kne kini English and kni English The pronunciation the word Koine itself gradually changed from close the Classical Attic pronunciation close the Modern Greek Greek the language has been referred Hellenistic Koin the sense Hellenistic supraregional languagecitation needed Ancient scholars used the term koine several different senses Scholars such Apollonius Dyscolus second century and Aelius Herodianus second century maintained the term Koine refer the ProtoGreek language while others used refer any vernacular form Greek speech which differed somewhat from the literary language When Koine Greek became language literature the first century some people distinguished two forms written the literary postclassical form which should not confused with Atticism and vernacular the daytoday vernacular Others chose refer Koine the dialect Alexandria Alexandrian dialect even the universal dialect its timecitation needed Modern classicists have often used the former sense Koine Greek arose common dialect within the armies Alexander the Great Under the leadership Macedon their newly formed common variety was spoken from the Ptolemaic Kingdom Egypt the Seleucid Empire Mesopotamia replaced existing ancient Greek dialects with everyday form that people anywhere could understand Though elements Koine Greek took shape Classical Greece the postClassical period Greek defined beginning with the death Alexander the Great 323 when cultures under Greek sway turn began influence the language The passage into the next period known Medieval Greek dates from the foundation Constantinople Constantine the Great 330 The postClassical period Greek thus refers the creation and evolution Koine Greek throughout the entire Hellenistic and Roman eras history until the start the Middle Ages The linguistic roots the Common Greek dialect had been unclear since ancient times During the Hellenistic period most scholars thought Koine the result the mixture the four main Ancient Greek dialects the composition the Four This view was supported the early twentieth century Paul Kretschmer his book Die Entstehung der Koine 1901 while Ulrich von WilamowitzMoellendorff and Antoine Meillet based the intense Ionic elements the Koine instead and instead sea potent virile considered Koine simplified form Ionic The view accepted most scholars today was given the Greek linguist Georgios Hatzidakis who showed that despite the composition the Four the stable nucleus Koine Greek Attic other words Koine Greek can regarded Attic with the admixture elements especially from Ionic but also from other dialects The degree importance the nonAttic linguistic elements Koine can vary depending the region the Hellenistic World that respect the varieties Koine spoken the Ionian colonies Anatolia Pontus Pontic Greek would have more intense Ionic characteristics than others and those Laconia and Cyprus would preserve some Doric and Arcadocypriot characteristics respectively The literary Koine the Hellenistic age resembles Attic such degree that often mentioned Common Attic The first scholars who studied Koine both Alexandrian and contemporary times were classicists whose prototype had been the literary Attic Greek the Classical period and frowned upon any other variety Ancient Greek Koine Greek was therefore considered decayed form Greek which was not worthy attention The reconsideration the historical and linguistic importance Koine Greek began only the early 19th century where renowned scholars conducted series studies the evolution Koine throughout the entire Hellenistic period and Roman Empire The sources used the studies Koine have been numerous and unequal reliability The most significant ones are the inscriptions the postClassical periods and the papyri for being two kinds texts which have authentic content and can studied directly Other significant sources are the Septuagint the somewhat literal Greek translation the Old Testament and the Greek New Testament The teaching the Testaments was aimed the most common people and for that reason they use the most popular language the era Information can also derived from some Atticist scholars the Hellenistic and Roman periods who order fight the evolution the language published works which compared the correct Attic against the wrong Koine citing examples For example Phrynichus Arabius during the second century wrote Basilissa queen none the Ancients said but basileia queen basilis queen Dioria deadline extremely disreputable instead you will say prothesmia appointed time not say pantote always but hekastote every time and dia pantos continually Other sources can based random findings such inscriptions vases written popular painters mistakes made Atticists due their imperfect knowledge Attic Greek even some surviving GrecoLatin glossaries the Roman period Bono die venistiGood day you came vis veni mecumIf you want come with UbiWhere amicum nostrum LuciumTo our friend Lucius Quid enim habetIndeed what does haveWhat with him AegrotatHes sick Finally very important source information the ancient Koine the modern Greek language with all its dialects and its own Koine form which have preserved some the ancient languages oral linguistic details which the written tradition has lost For example Pontic and Cappadocian Greek preserved the ancient pronunciation for standard Modern Greek etc while the Tsakonian language preserved the long instead etc and the other local characteristics Doric Greek Dialects from the southern part the Greekspeaking regions Dodecanese Cyprus etc preserve the pronunciation the double similar consonants while others pronounce many words preserve ancient double forms etc Linguistic phenomena like the above imply that those characteristics survived within Koine which turn had countless variations the Greekspeaking world Biblical Koine refers the varieties Koine Greek used Bible translations into Greek and related texts Its main sources are There has been some debate what degree Biblical Greek represents the mainstream contemporary spoken Koine and what extent contains specifically Semitic substratum features These could have been induced either through the practice translating closely from Biblical Hebrew Aramaic originals through the influence the regional nonstandard Greek spoken originally Aramaicspeaking Hellenised Jews Some the features discussed this context are the Septuagints normative absence the particles and and the use denote came pass Some features Biblical Greek which are thought have originally been nonstandard elements eventually found their way into the main the Greek language Thackery Grammar the Old Testament Greek According the Septuagint 1909 wrote that only the five books the Pentateuch parts the Book Joshua and the Book Isaiah may considered good Koine One issue debated scholars whether and how much the translation the Pentateuch influenced the rest the Septuagint including the translation Isaiah Another point that scholars have debated the use ekklsa translation for the Hebrew qhl Old Testament scholar James Barr has been critical etymological arguments that ekklsia refers the community called God constitute his People Kyriakoula Papademetriou explains maintains that merely used for designating the notion meeting and gathering men without any particular character Therefore etymologizing this word could needless even misleading when could guide false meanings for example that name used for the people God Israel The authors the New Testament follow the Septuagint translations for over half their quotations from the Old Testament The historical present tense term used for present tense verbs that are used some narrative sections the New Testament describe events that are the past with respect the speaker This seen more works attributed Mark and John than Luke used 151 times the Gospel Mark passages where reader might expect past tense verb Scholars have presented various explanations for this the early 20th century some scholars argued that the use historical present tense Mark was due the influence Aramaic but this theory fell out favor the 1960s Another group scholars believed the historical present tense was used heighten the dramatic effect and this interpretation was favored the New American Bible translation Volume the 1929 edition Grammar the New Testament Howard argues that the heavy use the historical present Herodotus and Thucydides compared with the relatively infrequent usage Polybius and Xenophon was evidence that heavy use this verb tense feature vernacular Koine but other scholars have argued that the historical present can literary form denote semantic shifts more prominent material The term patristic Greek sometimes used for the Greek written the Greek Church Fathers the Early Christian theologians late antiquity Christian writers the earliest time tended use simple register Koin relatively close the spoken language their time following the model the Bible After the 4th century when Christianity became the state church the Roman Empire more learned registers Koin also came used The study all sources from the six centuries which are symbolically covered Koine reveals linguistic changes from ancient Greek elements the spoken language including grammar word formation vocabulary and phonology sound system Most new forms start off rare and gradually become more frequent until they are established most the changes between modern and ancient Greek were introduced via Koine Koine largely familiar and least partly intelligible most writers and speakers Modern Greek During the period generally designated Koine Greek great deal phonological change occurred the start the period pronunciation was virtually identical Ancient Greek phonology whereas the end had much more common with Modern Greek phonology The three most significant changes were the loss vowel length distinction the replacement the pitch accent system stress accent system and the monophthongization several diphthongs The Koine Greek the table represents reconstruction New Testament Koine Greek deriving some degree from the dialect spoken Judea and Galilee during the first century and similar the dialect spoken Alexandria Egypt The realizations certain phonemes differ from the more standard Attic dialect Koinecitation needed has spirantized with palatal allophone before frontvowels and plosive allophone after nasals while beginning develop fricative articulation intervocalically and still preserve their ancient aspirated plosive values while the unaspirated stops have perhaps begun develop voiced allophones after nasals Initial aspiration has also likely become optional sound for many speakers the popular variety Monophthongization including the initial stage the fortition the second element the diphthongs and the loss voweltiming distinctions are carried through but there still distinction between the four front vowels and which still rounded The following texts show differences from Attic Greek all aspects grammar morphology vocabulary and can inferred show differences phonology The following comments illustrate the phonological development within the period Koine The phonetic transcriptions are tentative and are intended illustrate two different stages the reconstructed development early conservative variety still relatively close Classical Attic and somewhat later more progressive variety approaching Modern Greek some respects The following excerpt from decree the Roman Senate the town Thisbae Boeotia 170 rendered reconstructed pronunciation representing hypothetical conservative variety mainland Greek Koin the early Roman period The transcription shows raising partial
