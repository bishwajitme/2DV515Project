definition music endeavors give accurate and concise explanation musics basic attributes essential nature and involves process defining what meant the term music Many authorities have suggested definitions but defining music turns out more difficult than might first imagined and there ongoing debate number explanations start with the notion music organized sound but they also highlight that this perhaps too broad definition and cite examples organized sound that are not defined music such human speech and sounds found both natural and industrial environments Kania 2014 The problem defining music further complicated the influence culture music cognition The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines music the art combining vocal instrumental sounds both produce beauty form harmony and expression emotion Concise Oxford Dictionary 1992 However the music genres known noise music and musique concrte for instance challenge these ideas about what constitutes musics essential attributes using sounds not widely considered musical like randomly produced electronic distortion feedback static cacophony and compositional processes using indeterminacy Priest 2013 132 Hagerty 2007 oft cited notable example the dilemma defining music work entitled 433 1952 the American composer John Cage 19121992 The written score has three movements and directs the performers appear stage indicate gesture other means when the piece begins then make sound and only mark sections and the end gesture What heard are only whatever ambient sounds may occur the room Some argue this not music because for example contains sounds that are conventionally considered musical and the composer and performers exert control over the organization the sounds heard Dodd 2013 Others argue music because the conventional definitions musical sounds are unnecessarily and arbitrarily limited and control over the organization the sounds achieved the composer and performers through their gestures that divide what heard into specific sections and comprehensible form Gann 2010 Because differing fundamental concepts music the languages many cultures not contain word that can accurately translated music that

out that Ludwig van Beethovens Grosse Fuge 1825 sounded like noise his audience the time Indeed Beethovens publishers persuaded him remove from its original setting the last movement string quartet did replacing with sparkling Allegro They subsequently published separately Watson 10910clarification needed Musicologist JeanJacques Nattiez considers the difference between noise and music nebulous explaining that The border between music and noise always culturally definedwhich implies that even within single society this border does not always pass through the same place short there rarely consensus all accounts there single and intercultural universal concept defining what music might Nattiez 1990 oftencited definition music that organized sound term originally coined modernist composer Edgard Varse Goldman 1961 133 reference his own musical aesthetic Varses concept music organized sound fits into his vision sound living matter and musical space open rather than bounded Chou 1966a conceived the elements his music terms soundmasses likening their organization the natural phenomenon crystallization Chou 1966b 157 Varse thought that stubbornly conditioned ears anything new music has always been called noise and posed the question what music but organized noises Varse and Chou 1966 The fifteenth edition the Encyclopdia Britannica states that while there are sounds that can described inherently unmusical musicians each culture have tended restrict the range sounds they will admit human organizing element often felt implicit music sounds produced nonhuman agents such waterfalls birds are often described musical but perhaps less often music The composer Murray Schafer 1996 284 states that the sound classical music has decays granular has attacks fluctuates swollen with impuritiesand all this creates musicality that comes before any cultural musicality However the view semiologist JeanJacques Nattiez just music whatever people choose recognize such noise whatever recognized disturbing unpleasant both Nattiez 1990 4748 See music social construct below Levi Bryant defines music not language but markedbased problemsolving method such mathematics Ashby 2004 Most definitions music include reference sound and list universals music can generated stating the elements aspects sound pitch timbre loudness duration spatial location and texture Burton 2015 2228 However terms more specifically relating music following Wittgenstein cognitive psychologist Eleanor Rosch proposes that categories are not clean cut but that something may more less member category Rosch 1973 328 such the search for musical universals would fail and would not provide one with valid definition Levitin 2006 13639 This primarily because other cultures have different understandings relation the sounds that English language writers refer music Many people however share general idea music The Websters definition music typical example the science art ordering tones sounds succession combination and temporal relationships produce composition having unity and continuity Websters Collegiate Dictionary online edition This approach the definition focuses not the construction but the experience music extreme statement the position has been articulated the Italian composer Luciano Berio Music everything that one listens with the intention listening music Berio Dalmonte and Varga 1985 This approach permits the boundary between music and noise change over time the conventions musical interpretation evolve within culture different different cultures any given moment and vary from person person according their experience and proclivities further consistent with the subjective reality that even what would commonly considered music experienced nonmusic the mind concentrating other matters and thus not perceiving the sounds essence music Clifton 1983 his 1983 book Music Heard which sets out from the phenomenological position Husserl MerleauPonty and Ricur Thomas Clifton defines music ordered arrangement sounds and silences whose meaning presentative rather than denotative This definition distinguishes music end itself from compositional technique and from sounds purely physical objects More precisely music the actualization the possibility any sound whatever present some human being meaning which experiences with his bodythat say with his mind his feelings his senses his will and his metabolism Clifton 1983 therefore certain reciprocal relation established between person his behavior and sounding object Clifton 1983 Clifton accordingly differentiates music from nonmusic the basis the human behavior involved rather than either the nature compositional technique sounds purely physical objects Consequently the distinction becomes question what meant musical behavior musically behaving person one whose very being absorbed the significance the sounds being experienced However not altogether accurate say that this person listening the sounds First the person doing more than listening perceiving interpreting judging and feeling Second the preposition puts too much stress the sounds such Thus the musically behaving person experiences musical significance means through the sounds Clifton 1983 this framework Clifton finds that there are two things that separate music from nonmusic musical meaning presentative and music and nonmusic are distinguished the idea personal involvement the notion personal involvement which lends significance the word ordered this definition music Clifton 1983 This not understood however sanctification extreme relativism since precisely the subjective aspect experience which lured many writers earlier this century down the path sheer opinionmongering Later this trend was reversed renewed interest objective scientific otherwise nonintrospective musical analysis But have good reason believe that musical experience not purely private thing like seeing pink elephants and that reporting about such experience need not subjective the sense being mere matter opinion Clifton 1983 Cliftons task then describe musical experience and the objects this experience which together are called phenomena and the activity describing phenomena called phenomenology Clifton 1983 important stress that this definition music says nothing about aesthetic standards Music not fact thing the world but meaning constituted human beings talk about such experience meaningful way demands several things First have willing let the composition speak let reveal its own order and significance Second have willing question our assumptions about the nature and role musical materials Last and perhaps most important have ready admit that describing meaningful experience itself meaningful Clifton 1983 Music often artentertainment total social fact whose definitions vary according era and culture according Jean Molino 1975 often contrasted with noise According musicologist JeanJacques Nattiez The border between music and noise always culturally definedwhich implies that even within single society this border does not always pass through the same place short there rarely consensus all accounts there single and intercultural universal concept defining what music might Nattiez 1990 478 and Given the above demonstration that there limit the number the genre variables that might intervene definition the musical Molino 1975 organization definitions and elements necessary Nattiez 1990 describes definitions according tripartite semiological scheme similar the following There are three levels description the poietic the neutral and the esthesic Table describing types definitions music Nattiez 1990 Because this range definitions the study music comes wide variety forms There the study sound and vibration acoustics the cognitive study music the study music theory and performance practice music theory and ethnomusicology and the study the reception and history music generally called musicology Composer Iannis Xenakis Towards Metamusic chapter Formalized Music defined music the following way Xenakis 1971 181
