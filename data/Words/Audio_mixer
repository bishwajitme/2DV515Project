sound recording and reproduction and sound reinforcement systems mixing console electronic device for combining sounds many different audio signals Inputs the console include microphones being used singers and for picking acoustic instruments signals from electric electronic instruments recorded music Depending the type mixer able control analog digital signals The modified signals are summed produce the combined output signals which can then broadcast amplified through sound reinforcement system recorded Mixing consoles are used many applications including recording studios public address systems sound reinforcement systems nightclubs broadcasting television and film postproduction typical simple application combines signals from microphones stage into amplifier that drives one set loudspeakers for the audience mixer may have only two channels for mixing two record players coffeehouses tiny stage might only have six channel mixer enough for two singerguitarists and percussionist nightclub stages mixer for rock music shows may have channels for mixing the signals from rhythm section lead guitar and several vocalists mixing console professional recording studio may have many channels practice mixers more than simply mix signals They can provide phantom power for condenser microphones pan control which changes sounds apparent position the stereo soundfield filtering and equalization which enables sound engineers boost cut selected frequencies improve the sound dynamic range compression which allows engineers increase the overall gain the system channel without exceeding the dynamic limits the system routing facilities send the signal from the mixer another device such sound recording system control room and monitoring facilities whereby one number sources can routed loudspeakers headphones for listening often without affecting the mixers main output Some mixers have onboard electronic effects such reverb Some mixers intended for small venue live performance applications may include integrated power amplifier mixing console also known audio mixer audio console mixing desk sound mixer sound board simply board mixer analog mixing board divided into functional sections Some the more important functional sections are subdivided into subsections The channel input strips are usually bank identical monaural stereo input channels arranged columns Typically each channels column contains number rotary potentiometer knobs buttons and faders for controlling the gain the input preamplifier adjusting the equalization the signal each channel controlling routing the input signal other functional sections and adjusting the channels contribution the overall mix being produced The types inputs that can plugged into mixer depend the intended purpose the mixer mixer intended for live venue recording studio typically has range input jacks such XLR connectors for microphones and the outputs from boxes and jacks for line level sources mixer typically has RCA connectors inputs for prerecorded music being played back turntables players and single mic input Depending the mixer channel may have buttons which enable the audio engineer reroute the signal different output for monitoring purposes turn attenuator pad often reducing the signal 20dB prevent audio clipping activate other features such highpass filter Some higherpriced mixers have parametric equalizer semiparametric equalizer for one more the equalizer frequency bands often the middle range The channel strips are typically numbered that the audio engineer can identify the different channels For each channel input mixer provides one more input jacks mid largesized live venue and sound recording consoles these input jacks are numbered well and consolidated patch bay smaller mixers the input jacks may mounted the top panel the mixer facilitate the connection and disconnection inputs during the use the mixer The input strip usually separated into sections many consoles these sections are color coded for quick identification the operator Each signal singers vocal mic the signal from electric bass amps box etc that plugged into the mixer has its own channel Depending the specific mixer each channel stereo monaural most mixers each channel has XLR input and many have RCA quarterinch TRS phone connector line inputs The smallest least expensive mixers may only have one XLR input with the other inputs being line inputs These can used singerguitarist other small acts The first knob the top input strip typically trim gain control The inputs buffer the signal from the external device and this controls the amount amplification attenuation applied the input signal bring nominal level for processing Due the high gains involved around for microphone this stage where most noise and interference picked Balanced inputs and connectors such XLR phone connectors reduce interference problems microphone that was plugged directly into power amplifier would not produce sound because the microphones signal too weak the microphone signal needs plugged into preamplifier strengthen the signal that strong enough amplified the power amplifier For some very strong line level signals the signal that plugged into the mixer might too strong and might causing audio clipping For signals that are too strong pad can used attenuate the gain Audio engineers typically aim achieving good gain structure for each channel obtain good gain structure engineers usually raise the gain high they can before audio clipping results this helps provide the best signal noise ratio ratio mixing console may provide insert points after the buffergain stage These provide send and return connection for external processors that only affect individual channels signal Effects that operate multiple channels connect auxiliary sends below The auxiliary send routes split the incoming signal auxiliary bus which can then routed external devices Auxiliary sends can either prefader postfader that the level prefade send set the auxiliary send control whereas postfade sends depend the position the channel fader well Auxiliary sends can send the signal external processor such reverb with the return signal routed through another channel designated auxiliary return These are normally postfader Prefade auxiliary sends can provide monitor mix musicians onstage which they hear through monitor speakers pointing the performers inear monitors this mix thus independent the main mix Most live radio broadcasting sound boards send audio through program channels See image the lower left When given channel button selected the audio will sent that device transmitter Program typically the onair live feed what those listening the broadcast will hear Most boards have programming channels though some have more options Often one the programming channels will feed one more computers used for editing sound playback Another channel may used send audio the talents headset they are broadcasting from remote area Further channel controls affect the equalization the signal separately attenuating boosting range frequencies The smallest least expensive mixers may only have bass and treble controls Most midrange and higherpriced mixers have bass midrange and treble even additional midrange controls lowmid and highmid Many highend mixing consoles have parametric equalizer each channel Some mixers have general equalization control either graphic parametric the output for controlling the tone the overall mix The cue system allows the operator listen one more selected signals without affecting the consoles audio outputs sound engineer can use the cue feature get sound recording they wish play soon cued the start point song without the listeners hearing these actions The signal from the cue system fed the consoles headphone amp and may also available linelevel output that intended drive monitor speaker system The terms PFL Pre Fade Listen and AFL After Fade Listen are used characterize the point the signal flow from which the cue signal derived Input channels are usually configured PFL the operator can audition the channel without sending any mix Consoles with cue feature have dedicated button each channel typically labeled Cue AFL PFL Solo Listen Solo Place SIP related feature advanced consoles typically controlled the Cue button but unlike Cue SIP destructive that has major impact the output mix mutes everything except channels being soloed SIP useful for setup mixing board and troubleshooting that allows the operator quickly mute everything but the signal being worked and adjusted For example audio engineer having problems with hot synthesizer keyboard input signal which leading unwanted clipping they may press the SIP solely hear the keyboard channel that they can trim the input gain press pad button give just one example The SIP potentially disastrous engaged accidentally during performance will mute all the channels except one most consoles require the operator take very deliberate actions engage SIP mode Each channel mixer has volume control fader that allows adjustment the level that channel These are usually sliders near the front the mixing board although some smaller mixers use rotary controls save space The signals are summed create the main mix combined bus submix group channels that are then added get the final mix for instance many drum mics could grouped into bus and then the proportion drums the final mix can controlled with one bus fader bus can often processed just like individual input channel allowing the engineer process whole group signals once Once again using the drum kit example the use busprocessing can enable the sound engineer run all the drum kit through audio compressor effect reduce unwanted signal peaks rather than having route all the more mic signals the drum kit individually There may also insert points for certain bus even the entire mix Some higherend consoles use voltagecontrolled amplifier VCA groups VCAs and DCAs function somewhat like subgroups but let the operator control the level multiple input channels with single fader Unlike subgroups submix created The audio signals from the assigned channels remain routed independently VCA assignments Since submix created not possible insert processing such compressors into VCADCA group addition most VCADCAequipped consoles postfader auxiliary send levels are affected the VCA master This usually desirable postfader auxiliary sends are commonly used for effects such reverb and sends these effects should track changes the channel signal level The master control section used adjust the levels the overall output the mixer typical live sound mixing context with band playing venue consisting rhythm section solo instrumentalists and singers the master control section enables the audio engineer control the volume the entire group with just one fader for monaural mixers pair left and right faders for stereo mixers most mixers the master control fader However some minimixers rotary knobs are used instead save space The master control section large live venue sound recording mixer typically has subgroup faders master faders master auxiliary mixing bus level controls and auxiliary return level controls addition they may have solo monitoring controls stage talkback microphone control the sound engineer can talk the band who may some distance away live show who might separated isolation booth the recording studio muting controls and output matrix mixer smaller mixers the inputs are the left the mixing board and the master controls are the right larger mixers the master controls are the center with input faders and channel strips both sides Subgroup and main output fader controls are often found together the right hand side the mixer larger consoles center section flanked banks input channels Matrix routing often contained this master section are headphone and local loudspeaker monitoring controls Talkback controls allow conversation with the artist through their monitors headphones inear monitor test tone generator might located the master output section Aux returns such those signals returning from external processors are often the master section Finally there are usually one more peak meters peak meters often use LEDs indicate the levels for each channel for the master outputs and indicate whether the console levels are clipping the signal The sound engineer typically adjusts the gain the input signals get the strongest signal that can obtained without causing clipping unwanted distortion causing audio feedback howls Having the gain set high possible improves the signal noise ratio Most mixers have least one additional output besides the main mix These are either individual bus outputs auxiliary outputs used for instance output different mix onstage monitors The audio level meters which may meters with needles LEDs may above the input and master sections they may integrated into the input and master sections themselves The audio level meters indicate when the signals are clipping audio level meters using LEDs there may different coloured LEDs indicate when there signal present the channels input the audio level the channel typically lighting more LEDs and clipping which may indicated using different coloured LED One colour coding system use green LEDs indicate signal presence and the audio level one more amber LEDs indicate that the channel approaching clipping and one more red LEDs indicate the presence clipping the human ear experiences audio level logarithmic fashion both amplitude and frequency mixing console controls and displays are almost always decibels logarithmic measurement system Since relative measurement and not unit itself the meters must referenced nominal level The professional nominal level used professional mixers considered dBucitation needed The consumer grade level dBV For convenience some mixing consoles include inserts patch bay patch panel Patch bays are mainly used for recording mixers However live sound mixers may also include patch bays live sound the cables from the onstage microphones and instrument outputs are not typically plugged directly into the mixer because this would require large number cables from the stage the mixer Instead the onstage mic and instrument cables are typically plugged into the patch bay thick snake cable which runs from the stage the mixer The outputs from the snakes second patch bay near the mixer are then plugged into the mixer Most but not all audio mixers can Some mixers can Some mixing consoles particularly those designed for broadcast and live sound include facilities for mirroring two consoles making both consoles exact copies each other with the same inputs and outputs the same settings and the same audio mix There are two primary reasons for doing this one the event hardware failure second redundant console already place and can switched important feature for live broadcasts second allows the operators set two identical mix positions one front house where the audio will mixed during performance and the other some other location within the theater with the broadcasting equipment this way the acoustics front house are unfavorable mix can programmed acoustically better position the room and the presets the faders and knobs can accessed from the front house console during the performance Digital mixing console sales have increased dramatically since their introduction the 1990s Yamaha sold more than 1000 PM5D mixers July 2005 and other manufacturers are seeing increasing sales their digital products Digital mixers are more versatile than analog ones and offer many new features such reconfigure signal routing the touch button addition digital consoles often include processing capabilities such compression gating reverb automatic feedback suppression and delay Some products are expandable via thirdparty software features called plugins that add further reverb compression delay and toneshaping tools Several digital mixers include spectrograph and real time analyzer functions few incorporate loudspeaker management tools such crossover filtering and limiting Digital signal processing can perform automatic mixing for some simple applications such courtrooms conferences and panel discussions Consoles with motorized faders can read and write console automation Digital mixers have unavoidable amount latency propagation delay ranging from less than 1ms much 10ms depending the model digital mixer and what functions are engaged This small amount delay not problem for loudspeakers aimed the audience even monitor wedges aimed the artist but can disorienting and unpleasant for IEMs Inear monitors where the artist hears their voice acoustically their head and electronically amplified their ears but delayed couple milliseconds Every analog digital conversion and digital analog conversion within digital mixer entails propagation delay Audio inserts favorite external analog processors make for almost double the usual delay Further delay can traced format conversions such from ADAT AES3 and from normal digital signal processing steps Within digital mixer there can differing amounts latency depending the routing and how much DSP use Assigning signal two parallel paths with significantly different processing each path can result extreme comb filtering when recombined Some digital mixers incorporate internal methods latency correction that such problems are avoided the 2010s analog consoles remain popular they have column dedicated physical knobs buttons and faders for each channel which logical and familiar many users well generations audio engineers have been trained analog mixers This takes more physical space but can accommodate rapid responses changing performance conditions Most digital mixers use technology reduce physical space requirements entailing compromises user interface such single shared channel adjustment area that selectable for only one channel time Additionally most digital mixers have virtual pages layers that change fader banks into separate controls for additional inputs for adjusting equalization aux send levels This layering can confusing for some operators Analog consoles make for simpler understanding hardware routing Many digital mixers allow internal reassignment inputs that convenient groupings inputs appear near each other the fader bank feature that can disorienting for persons having make hardware patch change the other hand many digital mixers allow for extremely easy building mix from saved data USB flash drives and other storage methods are employed bring past performance data new venue highly portable manner the new venue the traveling mix engineer simply plugs the collected data into the venues digital mixer and quickly makes small adjustments the local input and output patch layout allowing for full show readiness very short order Some digital mixers allow offline editing the mix feature that lets the traveling technician use laptop make anticipated changes the show while route shortening the time takes prepare the sound system for the artist Both digital and analog mixers rely analog microphone preamplifiers highgain circuit that increases the low signal level from microphone level that better matched the consoles internal operating level this respect both formats are par with each other digital mixer the microphone preamplifier followed analogtodigital converter Ideally this process carefully engineered deal gracefully with overloading and clipping while delivering accurate digital stream Further processing and mixing digital streams within mixer need avoid saturation maximum audio quality desired Analog mixers too must deal gracefully with overloading and clipping the microphone preamplifier and well avoiding overloading mix buses Very high frequency background hiss analog mixer always present though good gain stage management and turning unused channels down zero minimizes its audibility Idle subgroups left mix add background hiss the main outputs Many digital mixers avoid this problem lowlevel gating Digital circuitry more resistant outside interference from radio transmitters such walkietalkies and cell phones Hiss can reduced with electronic noise reduction devices with equalizer Many electronic design elements combine affect perceived sound quality making the global analog mixer digital mixer question difficult answer Experienced live sound professionals agree that the selection and quality the microphones and loudspeakers with their innate higher potential for creating distortion are much greater source coloration sound than the choice mixer The mixing style and experience the person mixing may more important than the make and model audio console Analog and digital mixers both have been associated with highquality concert performances and studio recordings Analog mixing live sound has had the option since the 1990s using wired remote controls for certain digital processes such monitor wedge equalization and parameter changes outboard reverb devices That concept has expanded until wired and wireless remote controls are being seen relation entire digital mixing platforms possible set sound system and mix via laptop touchscreen tablet Computer networks can connect digital system elements for expanded monitoring and control allowing the system technician make adjustments distant devices during the performance The use remote control technology can utilized reduce the amount venue space used for the front house mixing console nicknamed seatkills the music industry such using remote control technologies venue can enable them fit more paying customers into the venue For recorded sound the mixing process can performed screen using computer software and associated input output and recording hardware The traditional large control surface the mixing console not utilized saving space the engineers mix position software studio there either physical mixer fader bank all there compact group motorized faders designed fit into small space and connected the computer Many project studios use such spaceefficient solution the mixing room other times can serve business office media archival etc Software mixing heavily integrated part digital audio workstation Public address systems schools hospitals and other institutions use mixing console set microphones appropriate level and can add recorded sounds such music into the mix mixers usually have controls that help minimise audio feedback Most rock and pop bands use mixing console combine musical instruments and vocals that the mix can amplified through nightclubs system Among the highest quality bootleg recordings live performances are socalled soundboard recordings sourced directly from the mixing console Radio broadcasts use mixing desk select audio from different sources such players telephones remote feeds prerecorded advertisements and instudio live bands These consoles often referred airboards are apt have many fewer controls than mixers designed for live studio production mixing dropping panbalance and multibus monitoringaux feed knobs favor cue and output bus selectors since radio studio nearly all sources are either prerecorded preadjusted DJs playing music for dancers dance club use small mixer make smooth transitions between different songs which are played sound sources that are plugged into the mixer Compared with other mixers that are used sound recording and live sound mixers have far fewer inputs The most basic mixers have only two inputs Some mixers have four more inputs These sound sources could turntables players iPods The mixer also allows the use headphones cue the next song the desired starting point before playing Hip hop music DJs and Dub producers and engineers were early users the mixing board musical instrument Noise music musicians may create feedback loops within mixers creating instrument known noinput mixer The tones generated from noinput
