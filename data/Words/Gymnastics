Gymnastics sport that includes exercises requiring balance strength flexibility agility coordination and endurance The movements involved gymnastics contribute the development the arms legs shoulders back chest and abdominal muscle groups Alertness precision daring selfconfidence and selfdiscipline are mental traits that can also developed through gymnastics Gymnastics evolved from exercises used the ancient Greeks that included skills for mounting and dismounting horse and from circus performance skills Most forms competitive gymnastics events are governed the Fdration Internationale Gymnastique FIG Each country has its own national governing body BIW affiliated FIG Competitive artistic gymnastics the best known the gymnastic events typically involves the womens events vault uneven bars balance beam and floor exercise well the mens events floor exercise pommel horse still rings vault parallel bars and horizontal bar Other FIG disciplines include rhythmic gymnastics trampolining and tumbling acrobatic gymnastics and aerobic gymnastics Disciplines not currently recognized FIG include wheel gymnastics aesthetic group gymnastics mens rhythmic gymnastics TeamGym and mallakhamba Participants can include children young months old doing kindergym and childrens gymnastics recreational gymnasts ages and competitive gymnasts varying levels skill and worldclass athletes The word gymnastics derives from the common Greek adjective gymnos way the related verb gymnazo whose meaning train naked train gymnastic exercise generally train exercise The verb had this meaning because athletes ancient times exercised and competed without clothing came into use the 1570s from Latin gymnasticus from Greek gymnastikos fond skilled bodily exercise from gymnazein exercise train see gymnasium Gymnastics developed ancient Greece Sparta and Athens and was used method prepare men for warfare Sparta among the activities introduced into the training program was the Agoge exhibition gymnastics made gymnastic elements the form the Pyrrhica dance military styleperformed for state dignitaries the final year students training The maneuvers were performed naked except for the tools war Athens combined this more physical training with education the mind the Palestra physical education training center the discipline educating the body and educating the mind were combined allowing for form gymnastics that was more aesthetic and individual and which left behind the form that focused strictness discipline the emphasis defeating records and focus strength Don Francisco Amors Ondeano was born February 1770 Valencia and died August 1848 Paris was Spanish colonel and the first person introduce educative gymnastic France Jahn promoted the use parallel bars rings and high bars international competition The Federation International Gymnastics FIG was founded Liege 1881 the end the nineteenth century mens gymnastics competition was popular enough included the first modern Olympic Games 1896 From then until the early 1950s both national and international competitions involved changing variety exercises gathered under the rubric gymnastics that included for example synchronized team floor calisthenics rope climbing high jumping running and horizontal ladder During the 1920s women organized and participated gymnastics events The first womens Olympic competition was primitive only involving synchronized calisthenics and track and field These games were held 1928 Amsterdam 1954 Olympic Games apparatus and events for both men and women had been standardized modern format and uniform grading structures including point system from had been agreed upon this time Soviet gymnasts astounded the world with highly disciplined and difficult performances setting precedent that continues Television has helped publicize and initiate modern age gymnastics Both mens and womens gymnastics now attract considerable international interest and excellent gymnasts can found every continent 2006 new points system for Artistic gymnastics was put into play With Score score being the difficulty score which 2009 based the top high scoring elements routine excluding Vault The Score Score the score for execution and given for how well the skills are performed The following disciplines are governed FIG Artistic Gymnastics usually divided into Mens and Womens Gymnastics Men compete six events Floor Exercise Pommel Horse Still Rings Vault Parallel Bars and Horizontal Bar while women compete four Vault Uneven Bars Balance Beam and Floor Exercise some countries women one time competed the rings high bar and parallel bars for example the 1950s the USSR 2006 FIG introduced new points system for Artistic gymnastics which scores are longer limited points The system used the for elite level competition Unlike the old code points there are two separate scores execution score and difficulty score the previous system the execution score was the only score was and still out 1000 except for short exercises During the gymnasts performance the judges deduct this score only fall off the event 100 deduction elite level gymnastics The introduction the difficulty score significant change The gymnasts difficulty score based what elements they perform and subject change they not perform complete all the skills they not connect skill meant connected another Connection bonuses are where deviation happens most common between the intended and actual difficulty scores can difficult connect multiple flight elements very hard connect skills the first skill not performed correctly The new code points allows the gymnasts gain higher scores based the difficulty the skills they perform well their execution There maximum score for difficulty can keep increasing the difficulty the skills increase the vaulting events gymnasts sprint down metres 82ft runway jump onto springboard perform roundoff handspring entry onto springboard land momentarily inverted the hands the vaulting horse vaulting table preflight segment then propel themselves forward backward off that platform twofooted landing postflight segment Every gymnast starts different point the vault runway depending their height and strength The postflight segment may include one more multiple saltos somersaults twisting movements roundoff entry vault called Yurchenko the most common vault the higher levels gymnastics When performing Yurchenko gymnasts round off their hands are the runway while their feet land the springboard From the roundoff position the gymnast travels backwards and executes back handspring that the hands land the vaulting table The gymnast then blocks off the vaulting platform into various twisting andor somersaulting combinations The postflight segment brings the gymnast her feet the lower levels gymnastics the gymnasts not perform this move These gymnasts will jump onto the springboard with both feet the same time and either front handspring onto the vault roundoff onto the vault 2001 the traditional vaulting horse was replaced with new apparatus sometimes known tongue horse vaulting table The new apparatus more stable wider and longer than the older vaulting horse approximately length and width giving gymnasts larger blocking surface This apparatus thus considered safer than the vaulting horse used the past With the addition this new safer vaulting table gymnasts are attempting more difficult and dangerous vaults the uneven bars the gymnast performs timed routine two parallel horizontal bars set different heights These bars are made fiberglass covered wood laminate prevent them from breaking the past bars were made wood but the bars were prone breaking providing incentive switch newer technologies The width and height the bars may adjusted the size needed individual gymnasts the past the uneven parallel bars were closer together The bars have been moved increasingly further apart allowing gymnasts perform swinging circling transitional and release moves that may pass over under and between the two bars the Elite level movements must pass through the handstand Gymnasts often mount the uneven bars using springboard small mat Gymnasts may use chalk MgCO3 and grips leather strip with holes for fingers protect hands and improve performance when performing this event The chalk helps take the moisture out gymnasts hands decrease friction and prevent rips tears the skin the hands dowel grips help gymnasts grip the bar The gymnast performs choreographed routine seconds length consisting leaps acrobatic skills somersaults turns and dance elements padded beam The beam 125 centimetres 4ft 1in from the ground metres 16ft 5in long and centimetres 39in wide This stationary object can also adjusted raised higher lower The event requires balance flexibility grace poise and strength The event gymnastics performed floor called floor exercise The English abbreviation for the event gymnastics scoring the past the floor exercise event was executed the bare floor mats such wrestling mats The floor event now occurs carpeted 12m 12m square usually consisting hard foam over layer plywood which supported springs generally called spring floor This provides firm surface that provides extra bounce spring when compressed allowing gymnasts achieve greater height and softer landing after the composed skill Gymnasts perform choreographed routine seconds the floor exercise event Depending the level they may choose their own known compulsory gymnast default music must played Levels three six the music the same for each levels along with the skills within the routine However recently the levels have switched Now levels 610 are optional levels and they get have custom routines made the optional levels levels six ten there are skill requirements for the routine but the athlete able pick her own music without any words The routine should consist tumbling passes series jumps leaps dance elements acrobatic skills and turns pivots one foot gymnast can perform four tumbling passes each which usually includes least one flight element without hand support Each level gymnastics requires the athlete perform different number tumbling passes level the United States gymnast required and levels 810 least tumbling passes are required Male gymnasts also perform 12meter 12meter spring floor series tumbling passes are performed demonstrate flexibility strength and balance Strength skills include circles scales and press handstands Mens floor routines usually have multiple passes that have total between 6070 seconds and are performed without music unlike the womens event Rules require that male gymnasts touch each corner the floor least once during their routine typical pommel horse exercise involves both single leg and double leg work Single leg skills are generally found the form scissors element often done the pommels Double leg work however the main staple this event The gymnast swings both legs circular motion clockwise counterclockwise depending preference and performs such skills all parts the apparatus make the exercise more challenging gymnasts will often include variations typical circling skill turning moores and spindles straddling their legs Flares Routines end when the gymnast performs dismount either swinging his body over the horse landing after handstand variation The rings are suspended wire cable from point 575 meters from the floor The gymnasts must perform routine demonstrating balance strength power and dynamic motion while preventing the rings themselves from swinging least one static strength move required but some gymnasts may include two three routine ends with dismount Gymnasts sprint down runway which maximum meters length before hurdling onto spring board The gymnast allowed choose where they start the runway The body position maintained while punching blocking using only shoulder movement the vaulting platform The gymnast then rotates standing position advanced gymnastics multiple twists and somersaults may added before landing Successful vaults depend the speed the run the length the hurdle the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle the kinesthetic awareness the air how well they stuck the landing and the speed rotation the case more difficult and complex vaults Men perform two bars executing series swings balances and releases that require great strength and coordination The width between the bars adjustable dependent upon the actual needs the gymnasts and usually high 28cm thick steel fiberglass bar raised 25m above the landing area all the gymnast has hold onto performs giant swings giants forward backward revolutions around the bar the handstand position release skills twists and changes direction using all the momentum from giants and then releasing the proper point enough height can achieved for spectacular dismounts such tripleback salto Leather grips are usually used help maintain grip the bar with women male gymnasts are also judged all their events including their execution degree difficulty and overall presentation skills gymnasts score comes from deductions taken from their start value The start value routine based the difficulty the elements the gymnast attempts and whether not the gymnast meets composition requirements The composition requirements are different for each apparatus this score called the score Deductions execution and artistry are taken from maximum 100 This score called the score The final score calculated taking deductions from the score and adding the result the scoreSince 2007 the scoring system has changed adding bonus plus the execution and then adding those two together get the final score tumbling pass dismount vault landing the final phase following take off and flight This critical skill terms execution competition scores general performance and injury occurrence Without the necessary magnitude energy dissipation during impact the risk sustaining injuries during somersaulting increases These injuries commonly occur the lower extremities such cartilage lesions ligament tears and bone bruisesfractures avoid such injuries and receive highperformance score proper technique must used the gymnast The subsequent ground contact impact landing phase must achieved using safe aesthetic and wellexecuted double foot landing successful landing gymnastics classified soft meaning the knee and hip joints are greater than degrees flexion higher flight phase results higher vertical ground reaction force Vertical ground reaction force represents external force which the gymnasts have overcome with their muscle force and affects the gymnasts linear and angular momentum Another important variable that affects linear and angular momentum the time the landing takes Gymnasts can decrease the impact force increasing the time taken perform the landing Gymnasts can achieve this increasing hip knee and ankle amplitude According FIG rules only women compete rhythmic gymnastics This sport that combines elements ballet gymnastics dance and apparatus manipulation The sport involves the performance five separate routines with the use five apparatus ball ribbon hoop clubs ropeon floor area with much greater emphasis the aesthetic rather than the acrobatic There are also group routines consisting gymnasts and apparatuses their choice Rhythmic routines are scored out possible points the score for artistry choreography and music averaged with the score for difficulty the moves and then added the score for execution International competitions are split between Juniors under sixteen their year birth and Seniors for women sixteen and over again their year birth Gymnasts Russia and Europe typically start training very young age and those their peak are typically their late teens 1519 early twenties The largest events the sport are the Olympic Games World Championships European Championships World Cup and GrandPrix Series The first World Championships were held 1963 with its first appearance the Olympics 1984 Trampolining and tumbling consists four events individual and synchronized trampoline double mini trampoline and tumbling also known power tumbling rod floor Since 2000 individual trampoline has been included the Olympic Games The first World Championships were held 1964 Individual routines trampolining involve buildup phase during which the gymnast jumps repeatedly achieve height followed sequence ten bounces without pause during which the gymnast performs sequence aerial skills Routines are marked out maximum score points Additional points with maximum the highest levels competition can earned depending the difficulty the moves and the length time taken complete the ten skills which indication the average height the jumps high level competitions there are two preliminary routines one which has only two moves scored for difficulty and one where the athlete free perform any routine This followed final routine which optional Some competitions restart the score from zero for the finals other add the final score the preliminary results Synchronized trampoline similar except that both competitors must perform the routine together and marks are awarded for synchronization well the form and difficulty the moves Double mini trampoline involves smaller trampoline with runup two scoring moves are performed per routine Moves cannot repeated the same order the doublemini during competition Skills can repeated skill competed mounter one routine and dismount another The scores are marked similar manner individual trampoline tumbling athletes perform explosive series flips and twists down sprung tumbling track Scoring similar trampolining Tumbling was originally contested one the events Mens Artistic Gymnastics the 1932 Summer Olympics and 1955 and 1959 the Pan American Games From 1974 1998 was

gymnastics marked out 3000 can higher Senior FIG level based difficulty The events consist Most competitions require balance and dynamic routine for each event though some will single mixed event The World Championships have been held since 1974 Aerobic gymnastics formally Sport Aerobics involves the performance routines individuals pairs trios groups people emphasizing strength flexibility and aerobic fitness rather than acrobatic balance skills Routines are performed for all individuals 7x7m floor and also for 1214 and 1517 trios and mixed pairs From 2009 all senior trios and mixed pairs

naisvoimistelu differs from Rhythmic Gymnastics that body movement large and continuous and teams are larger Athletes not use apparatus international AGG competitions compared Rhythmic Gymnastics where ball ribbon hoop and clubs are used the floor area The sport requires physical qualities such flexibility balance speed strength coordination and sense rhythm where movements the body are emphasized through the flow expression and aesthetic appeal good performance characterized uniformity and simultaneity The competition program consists versatile and varied body movements such body
