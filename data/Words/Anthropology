reference history Its present use first appeared Renaissance Germany the works Magnus Hundt and Otto Casmann Their New Latin anthropologia derived from the combining forms the Greek words nthrpos human and lgos study Its adjectival form appeared the works Aristotle began used English possibly via French Anthropologie the early 18th century 1647 the Bartholins founders the University Copenhagen defined lanthropologie follows Anthropology that say the science that treats man divided ordinarily and with reason into Anatomy which considers the body and the parts and Psychology which speaks the

chair anthropology and ethnography 1850 the National Museum Natural History France Jean Louis Armand Quatrefages Brau Various shortlived organizations anthropologists had already been formed The Socit Ethnologique Paris the first use Ethnology was formed 1839 Its members were primarily antislavery activists When slavery was abolished France 1848 the Socit was abandoned Meanwhile the Ethnological Society New York currently the American Ethnological Society was founded its model 1842 well the Ethnological Society London 1843 breakaway group the Aborigines Protection Society These anthropologists the times were liberal antislavery and prohumanrights activists They maintained international connections Anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results the comparative methods developed the earlier 19th century Theorists such diverse fields anatomy linguistics and Ethnology making featurebyfeature comparisons their subject matters were beginning suspect that similarities between animals languages and folkways were the result processes laws unknown them then For them the publication Charles Darwins the Origin Species was the epiphany everything they had begun suspect Darwin himself arrived his conclusions through comparison species had seen agronomy and the wild Darwin and Wallace unveiled evolution the late 1850s There was immediate rush bring into the social sciences Paul Broca Paris was the process breaking away from the Socit biologie form the first the explicitly anthropological societies the Socit dAnthropologie Paris meeting for the first time Paris 1859 When read Darwin became immediate convert Transformisme the French called evolutionism His definition now became the study the human group considered whole its details and relation the rest nature Broca being what today would called neurosurgeon had taken interest the pathology speech wanted localize the difference between man and the other animals which appeared reside speech discovered the speech center the human brain today called Brocas area after him His interest was mainly Biological anthropology but German philosopher specializing psychology Theodor Waitz took the theme general and social anthropology his sixvolume work entitled Die Anthropologie der Naturvlker 18591864 The title was soon translated The Anthropology Primitive Peoples The last two volumes were published posthumously Waitz defined anthropology the science the nature man nature meant matter animated the Divine breath was animist Following Brocas lead Waitz points out that anthropology new field which would gather material from other fields but would differ from them the use comparative anatomy physiology and psychology differentiate man from the animals nearest him stresses that the data comparison must empirical gathered experimentation The history civilization well ethnology are brought into the comparison presumed fundamentally that the species man unity and that the same laws thought are applicable all men Waitz was influential among the British ethnologists 1863 the explorer Richard Francis Burton and the speech therapist James Hunt broke away from the Ethnological Society London form the Anthropological Society London which henceforward would follow the path the new anthropology rather than just ethnology was the 2nd society dedicated general anthropology existence Representatives from the French Socit were present though not Broca his keynote address printed the first volume its new publication The Anthropological Review Hunt stressed the work Waitz adopting his definitions standard Among the first associates were the young Edward Burnett Tylor inventor cultural anthropology and his brother Alfred Tylor geologist Previously Edward had referred himself ethnologist subsequently anthropologist Similar organizations other countries followed The Anthropological Society Madrid 1865 the American Anthropological Association 1902 the Anthropological Society Vienna 1870 the Italian Society Anthropology and Ethnology 1871 and many others subsequently The majority these were evolutionist One notable exception was the Berlin Society for Anthropology Ethnology and Prehistory 1869 founded Rudolph Virchow known for his vituperative attacks the evolutionists Not religious himself insisted that Darwins conclusions lacked empirical foundation During the last three decades the 19th century proliferation anthropological societies and associations occurred most independent most publishing their own journals and all international membership and association The major theorists belonged these organizations They supported the gradual osmosis anthropology curricula into the major institutions higher learning 1898 the American Association for the Advancement Science was able report that educational institutions countries had some curriculum anthropology None the faculty members were under department named anthropology This meager statistic expanded the 20th century comprise anthropology departments the majority the worlds higher educational institutions many thousands number Anthropology has diversified from few major subdivisions dozens more Practical anthropology the use anthropological knowledge and technique solve specific problems has arrived for example the presence buried victims might stimulate the use forensic archaeologist recreate the final scene The organization has reached global level For example the World Council Anthropological Associations WCAA network national regional and international associations that aims promote worldwide communication and cooperation anthropology currently contains members from about three dozen nations Since the work Franz Boas and Bronisaw Malinowski the late 19th and early 20th centuries social anthropology Great Britain and cultural anthropology the have been distinguished from other social sciences its emphasis crosscultural comparisons longterm indepth examination context and the importance places participantobservation experiential immersion the area research Cultural anthropology particular has emphasized cultural relativism holism and the use findings frame cultural critiques This has been particularly prominent the United States from Boas arguments against 19thcentury racial ideology through Margaret Meads advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation current criticisms postcolonial oppression and promotion multiculturalism Ethnography one its primary research designs well the text that generated from anthropological fieldwork Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries the British tradition social anthropology tends dominate the United States anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed Franz Boas the early 20th century biological physical anthropology social cultural sociocultural anthropology and archaeology plus anthropological linguistics These fields frequently overlap but tend use different methodologies and techniques European countries with overseas colonies tended practice more ethnology term coined and defined Adam Kollr 1783 sometimes referred sociocultural anthropology the parts the world that were influenced the European tradition Anthropology global discipline involving humanities social sciences and natural sciences Anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences including the discoveries about the origin and evolution Homo sapiens human physical traits human behavior the variations among different groups humans how the evolutionary past Homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture and from social sciences including the organization human social and cultural relations institutions social conflicts etc Early anthropology originated Classical Greece and Persia and studied and tried understand observable cultural diversity such anthropology has been central the development several new late 20th century interdisciplinary fields such cognitive science global studies and various ethnic studies According Clifford Geertz anthropology perhaps the last the great nineteenthcentury conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally intact Long after natural history moral philosophy philology and political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors has remained diffuse assemblage ethnology human biology comparative linguistics and prehistory held together mainly the vested interests sunk costs and administrative habits academia and romantic image comprehensive scholarship Sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced structuralist and postmodern theories well shift toward the analysis modern societies During the 1970s and 1990s there was epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the disciplinepageneeded During this shift enduring questions about the nature and production knowledge came occupy central place cultural and social anthropology contrast archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist Due this difference epistemology the four subfields anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes cultural anthropology and social anthropology Cultural anthropology the comparative study the manifold ways which people make sense the world around them while social anthropology the study the relationships among individuals and groups Cultural anthropology more related philosophy literature and the arts how ones culture affects the experience for self and group contributing more complete understanding the peoples knowledge customs and institutions while social anthropology more related sociology and history that helps develop understanding social structures typically others and other populations such minorities subgroups dissidents etc There hardandfast distinction between them and these categories overlap considerable degree Inquiry sociocultural anthropology guided part cultural relativism the attempt understand other societies terms their own cultural symbols and values Accepting other cultures their own terms moderates reductionism crosscultural comparison This project often accommodated the field ethnography Ethnography can refer both methodology and the product

anthropology the application the theories and methods Historical Materialism the traditional concerns anthropology including but not limited noncapitalist societies Political economy introduced questions history and colonialism ahistorical anthropological theories social structure and culture Three main areas interest rapidly developed The first these areas was concerned with the precapitalist societies that were subject evolutionary tribal stereotypes Sahlins work huntergatherers the original affluent society did much dissipate that image The second area was concerned with the vast majority the worlds population the time the peasantry many whom were involved complex revolutionary wars such Vietnam The third area was colonialism imperialism and the creation the capitalist worldsystem More recently these political economists have more directly addressed issues industrial and postindustrial capitalism around the world Applied anthropology refers the application the method and theory anthropology the analysis and solution practical problems complex related researchbased instrumental methods which produce change stability specific cultural systems through the provision data initiation direct action andor the formulation policy More simply applied anthropology the practical side anthropological research includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community closely related development anthropology distinct from the more critical anthropology development Anthropology development tends view development from critical perspective The kind issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why key development goal alleviate poverty poverty increasing Why there such gap between plans and outcomes Why are those working development willing disregard history and the lessons might offer Why development externally driven rather than having internal basis short why does much planned development fail Kinship can refer both the study the patterns social relationships one more human cultures can refer the patterns social relationships themselves Over its history anthropology has developed number related concepts and terms such descent descent groups lineages affines cognates and even fictive kinship Broadly kinship patterns may considered include people related both descent ones social relations during development and also relatives marriage Feminist anthropology four field approach anthropology archeological biological cultural linguistic that seeks reduce male bias research findings anthropological hiring practices and the scholarly production knowledge Anthropology engages often with feminists from nonWestern traditions whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those white European and American feminists Historically such peripheral perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded less valid important than knowledge from the western world Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps correct this systematic bias mainstream feminist theory Feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction gender across societies Feminist anthropology inclusive birth anthropology specialization The first AfricanAmerican female anthropologist and Caribbeanist said Vera Mae Green who studied ethnic and

interdisciplinary subfield anthropology that studies the interaction cultural and mental processes This subfield tends focus ways which humans development and enculturation within particular cultural groupnbsp with its own history language practices and conceptual categoriesnbsp shape processes human cognition emotion perception motivation and mental health also examines how the understanding cognition emotion motivation and similar psychological processes inform constrain our models cultural and social processes Cognitive anthropology seeks explain patterns shared knowledge cultural innovation and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories the cognitive sciences especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology often through close collaboration with historians ethnographers archaeologists linguists musicologists and other specialists engaged the description and interpretation cultural forms Cognitive anthropology concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate the world around them Transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states consciousness and culture with transpersonal psychology the field much concerned with altered states consciousness ASC and transpersonal experience However the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology taking more cognizance crosscultural issuesnbsp for instance the roles myth ritual diet and texts evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences Political anthropology concerns the structure political systems looked from the basis the structure societies Political anthropology developed discipline concerned primarily with politics stateless societies new development started from the 1960s and still unfolding anthropologists started increasingly study more complex social settings which the presence states bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis local phenomena The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken two main levels Firstly anthropologists continued study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the stateregulated sphere patronclient relations tribal political organization Secondly anthropologists slowly started develop disciplinary concern with states and their institutions and the relationship between formal and informal political institutions anthropology the state developed and most thriving field today Geertz comparative work Negara the Balinese state early famous example Legal anthropology anthropology law specializes the crosscultural study social ordering Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly conflict management crime sanctions formal regulation More recent applications include issues such human rights legal pluralism and political uprisings Public anthropology was created Robert Borofsky professor Hawaii Pacific University demonstrate the ability anthropology and anthropologists effectively address problems beyond the discipline illuminating larger social issues our times well encouraging broad public conversations about them with the explicit goal fostering social change Cyborg anthropology originated subfocus group within the American Anthropological Associations annual meeting 1993 The subgroup was very closely related STS and the Society for the Social Studies Science Donna Haraways 1985 Cyborg Manifesto could considered the founding document cyborg anthropology first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications the term Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems has built specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions what means human beings Digital anthropology the study the relationship between humans and digitalera technology and extends various areas where anthropology and technology intersect sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology and sometimes considered part material culture The field new and thus has variety names with variety emphases These include technoanthropology digital ethnography cyberanthropology and virtual anthropology Ecological anthropology defined the study cultural adaptations environments The subfield also defined the study relationships between population humans and their biophysical environment The focus its research concerns how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt their environments and how their environment across space and time The contemporary perspective environmental anthropology and arguably least the backdrop not the focus most the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks today political ecology Many characterize this new perspective more informed with culture politics and power globalization localized issues century anthropology and more The focus and data interpretation often used for arguments foragainst creation policy and prevent corporate exploitation and damage land Often the observer has become active part the struggle either directly organizing participation indirectly articles documentaries books ethnographies Such the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people Hyde Park Ethnohistory the study ethnographic cultures and indigenous customs examining historical records also the study the history various ethnic groups that may may not exist today Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data its foundation Its historical methods and materials beyond the standard use documents and manuscripts Practitioners recognize the utility such source material maps music paintings photography folklore oral tradition site exploration archaeological materials museum collections enduring customs language and place names The anthropology religion involves the study religious institutions relation other social institutions and the comparison religious beliefs and practices across cultures Modern anthropology assumes that there complete continuity between magical thinking and religion and that every religion cultural product created the human community that worships Urban anthropology concerned with issues urbanization poverty and neoliberalism Ulf Hannerz quotes 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were notoriously agoraphobic lot antiurban definition Various social processes the Western World well the Third World the latter being the habitual focus attention anthropologists brought the attention specialists other cultures closer their homes There are two main approaches urban anthropology examining the types cities examining the social issues within the cities These two methods are overlapping and dependent each other defining different types cities one would use social factors well economic and political factors categorize the cities directly looking the different social issues one would also studying how they affect the dynamic the city Anthrozoology also known humananimal studies the study interaction between living things interdisciplinary field that overlaps with number other disciplines including anthropology ethology medicine psychology veterinary medicine and zoology major focus anthrozoologic research the quantifying the positive effects humananimal relationships either party and the study their interactions includes scholars from diverse range fields including anthropology sociology biology and philosophy Biocultural anthropology the scientific exploration the relationships between human biology and culture Physical anthropologists throughout the first half the 20th century viewed this relationship from racial perspective that from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead cultural differences After World War the emphasis began shift toward effort explore the role culture plays shaping human biology Evolutionary anthropology the interdisciplinary study the evolution human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and nonhominin primates Evolutionary anthropology based natural science and social science combining the human development with socioeconomic factors Evolutionary anthropology concerned with both biological and cultural evolution humans past and present based scientific approach and brings together fields such archaeology behavioral ecology psychology primatology and genetics dynamic and interdisciplinary field drawing many lines evidence understand the human experience past and present Forensic anthropology the application the science physical anthropology and human osteology legal setting most often criminal cases where the victims remains are the advanced stages decomposition forensic anthropologist can assist the identification deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed burned mutilated otherwise unrecognizable The adjective forensic refers the application this subfield science court law Paleoanthropology combines the disciplines paleontology and physical anthropology the study ancient humans found fossil hominid evidence such petrifacted bones and footprints Genetics and morphology specimens are crucially important this field Markers specimens such enamel fractures and dental decay teeth can also give insight into the behaviour and diet past populations Contemporary anthropology established science with academic departments most universities and colleges The single largest organization anthropologists the American Anthropological Association AAA which was founded 1903 Its members are anthropologists from around the globe 1989 group European and American scholars the field anthropology established the European Association Social Anthropologists EASA which serves major professional organization for anthropologists working Europe The EASA seeks advance the status anthropology Europe and increase visibility marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute the project global anthropology world anthropology Hundreds other organizations exist the various subfields anthropology sometimes divided nation region and many anthropologists work with collaborators other disciplines such geology physics zoology paleontology anatomy music theory art history sociology and belonging professional societies those disciplines well the field has matured has debated and arrived ethical principles aimed protecting both the subjects anthropological research well the researchers themselves and professional societies have generated codes ethics Anthropologists like other researchers especially historians and scientists engaged field research have over time assisted state policies and projects especially colonialism Some commentators have contended part their quest for scientific objectivity presentday anthropologists typically urge cultural relativism which has influence all the subfields anthropology This the notion that cultures should not judged anothers values viewpoints but examined dispassionately their own terms There should notions good anthropology one culture being better worse than another culture Ethical commitments anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide infanticide racism mutilation including circumcision and subincision and torture Topics like racism slavery and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies genes acculturation have been proposed not mention theories colonialism and many others root causes Mans inhumanity man illustrate the depth anthropological approach one can take just one these topics such racism and find thousands anthropological references stretching across all the major and minor subfields Anthropologists involvement with the government particular has caused bitter controversy within the discipline Franz Boas publicly objected participation World War and after the war published brief expose and condemnation the participation several American archaeologists espionage Mexico under their cover

armed forces while others worked intelligence for example Office Strategic Services and the Office War Information the same time David Prices work American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts the pursuit and dismissal several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathiescitation needed Attempts accuse anthropologists complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned surprisingly little Many anthropologists students and teachers were active the antiwar movement Numerous resolutions condemning the war all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly the annual meetings the American Anthropological Association AAAcitation needed Professional anthropological bodies often object the use anthropology for the benefit the state Their codes ethics statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings The Association Social Anthropologists the and Commonwealth ASA has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous The AAAs current Statement Professional Responsibility clearly states that relation with their own government and with host governments secret research secret reports debriefings any kind should agreed givencitation needed Anthropologists along with other social scientists are working with the military part the Armys strategy Afghanistan The Christian Science Monitor reports that Counterinsurgency efforts focus better grasping and meeting local needs Afghanistan under the Human Terrain System HTS program addition HTS teams are working with the military

anthropology and the military possible CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that further recognize the problem allowing HTS define the meaning anthropology within DoD Before WWII British social anthropology and American cultural anthropology were still distinct traditions After the war enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began speak them collectively sociocultural anthropology There are several characteristics that tend unite anthropological work One the central characteristics that anthropology tends provide comparatively more holistic account phenomena and tends highly empirical The quest for holism leads most anthropologists study particular place problem phenomenon detail using variety methods over more extensive period than normal many parts academia the 1990s and 2000s calls for clarification what constitutes culture how observer knows where his her own culture ends and another begins and other crucial topics writing anthropology were heard These dynamic relationships between what can observed the ground opposed what can observed compiling many local observations remain fundamental any kind anthropology whether cultural biological linguistic archaeological Biological anthropologists are interested both human variation and the possibility human universals behaviors ideas concepts shared virtually all human cultures They use many different methods study but modern population genetics participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists into the field which means traveling community its own setting something called fieldwork the biological physical side human measurements genetic samples nutritional data may gathered and published articles monographs Along with dividing their project theoretical emphasis anthropologists typically divide the world into relevant time periods and geographic regions Human time Earth divided into relevant cultural traditions based material such the Paleolithic and the Neolithic particular use archaeologycitation needed Further cultural subdivisions according tool types such Olduwan Mousterian Levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists understanding major trends the human pastcitation needed Anthropologists and geographers share approaches culture regions well since mapping cultures central both sciences making comparisons across cultural traditions timebased and cultural regions spacebased anthropologists have developed various kinds comparative method central part their science Because anthropology developed from many different enterprises see History anthropology including but not limited fossilhunting exploring documentary filmmaking paleontology primatology antiquity dealings and curatorship philology etymology genetics regional analysis ethnology history philosophy and religious studies difficult characterize the entire field brief article although attempts write histories the entire field have been made Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed the study other cultures both terms time past societies and space nonEuropeannonWestern societies For example the classic urban anthropology Ulf Hannerz the introduction his seminal Exploring the City Inquiries Toward Urban Anthropology mentions that the Third World had habitually received most attention anthropologists who traditionally specialized other cultures looked for them far away and started look across the tracks only late 1960s Now there exist many works focusing peoples and topics very close the authors home also argued that other fields study like History and Sociology the contrary focus disproportionately the West France the study Western societies has been traditionally left sociologists but this increasingly changing starting the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like Terrain fieldwork and developing with the center founded Marc Aug Centre danthropologie des mondes contemporains the Anthropological Research Center Contemporary Societies Since the 1980s has become common for social and cultural anthropologists set ethnographic research the North Atlantic region frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research single locale There has also been related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life ordinary people increasingly research set settings such scientific laboratories social movements governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses
