music whole tone scale scale which each note separated from its neighbours the interval whole tone twelvetone equal temperament there are only two complementary whole tone scales both sixnote hexatonic scales The whole tone scale has leading tone and because all tones are the same distance apart single tone stands out and the scale creates blurred indistinct effect This effect especially emphasised the fact that triads built such scale tones are all augmented triads Indeed all six tones whole tone scale can played simply with two augmented triads whose roots are major second apart Since they are symmetrical whole tone scales not give strong impression the tonic tonality The composer Olivier Messiaen called the whole tone scale his first mode limited transposition The composer and music theorist George Perle calls the whole tone scale interval cycle Since there are only two possible whole tone scale positions that the whole tone scale can transposed only once either C20 C21 For this reason the whole tone scale also maximally even and may considered generated collection Due this symmetry the hexachord consisting the wholetone scale not distinct under inversion more than one transposition Thus many composers have used one the almost wholetone hexachords whose individual structural differences can seen result only from difference the location placement semitone within the otherwise wholetone series Alexander Scriabins mystic chord primary example being whole tone scale with one note raised semitone this alteration allows for greater variety resources through transposition 1662 Johann Rudolf Ahle wrote melody the lyrics Franz Joachim Burmeisters ist genug enough beginning with four notes the whole tone scale the four syllables Johann Sebastian Bach chose the chorale end his cantata Ewigkeit Donnerwort BWV set for four parts The first four measures are shown below Mozart also used the scale his Musical Joke for strings and horns the 19th century

Prince Igor and the Commanders theme Dargomyzhskys The Stone Guest Further examples can found the works RimskyKorsakov the sea kings music Sadko and also Scheherezade Shown below the opening theme Scheherazade which simply descending wholetone scale with diatonic trimmings Notes the whole tone scale are highlighted For some short piano pieces written completely wholetone scale see Nos and from Rebikovs Une fte from 1907 Colles names the childhood the wholetone scale the music Berlioz and Schubert France and Austria and then Russians Glinka and Dargomyzhsky Claude Debussy who had been influenced Russians along with other impressionist composers made extensive use whole tone scales Voiles the second piece Debussys first book Prludes almost entirely within one whole tone scale The opening measures are shown below Janeks use the scale the bracing opening the second movement his Sinfonietta quote William Austin utterly different Austin writes Janeks free chromaticism never loses touch with diatonic scale for long Though the wholetone scale prominent much his music after 1905 when encountered Debussy serves simply fit the motifs over augmented chords The same motifs return from the wholetone the diatonic scale without emphasizing the contrast The first measures the second movement Sinfonietta are shown below The first Alban Bergs Seven Early Songs opens with wholetone passage both the orchestral accompaniment and the vocal line that enters bar later Berg also quotes the Bach chorale setting referred above his Violin Concerto The last four notes the 12tone row Berg

structure his earlier tune Impressions However these are only the most overt examples the use this scale jazz vast number jazz tunes including many standards use augmented chords and their corresponding scales well usually create tension turnarounds substitute for dominant seventh chord For instance augmented 5th dominant chord which altered scale tones would work before resolving tritone substitution chord such D711 often used which whole tone scale tones will work the sharpened 11th degree being and the flattened 7th being the enharmonic equivalent the major third the dominant chord Art Tatum and Thelonious Monk are two pianists who used the whole tone scale extensively and creatively Monks Four One 1948 and TrinkleTinkle 1952 are fine examples this prominent example the whole tone scale that made its way into pop music are bars three and four the opening Stevie Wonders 1972 song You Are the Sunshine Life The rga Sahera Hindustani classical music uses the
