associated with aggression and machismo 1968 three the genres most famous pioneers Led Zeppelin Black Sabbath and Deep Purple were founded Though they came attract wide audiences they were often derided critics During the mid1970s Judas Priest helped spur the genres evolution discarding much its blues influence Motrhead introduced punk rock sensibility and increasing emphasis speed Beginning the late 1970s bands the new wave British heavy metal such Iron Maiden and Saxon followed similar vein Before the end the decade heavy metal fans became known metalheads headbangers During the 1980s glam metal became popular with groups such Mtley Cre Poison and Def Leppard Underground scenes produced array more aggressive styles thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such Metallica Slayer Megadeth and Anthrax while other extreme subgenres heavy metal such death metal with bands such Death Possessed and Obituary and black metal with bands such Mayhem Bathory and Immortal remain subcultural phenomena Since the mid1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition the genre These include groove metal with bands such Pantera Sepultura and Lamb God and metal with bands such Korn Slipknot and Linkin Park the latter which often incorporates elements grunge and hip hop Heavy metal traditionally characterized loud distorted guitars emphatic rhythms dense bassanddrum sound and vigorous vocals Heavy metal subgenres variously emphasize alter omit one more these attributes The New York Times critic Jon Pareles writes the taxonomy popular music heavy metal major subspecies hardrockthe breed with less syncopation less blues more showmanship and more brute force The typical band lineup includes drummer bassist rhythm guitarist lead guitarist and singer who may may not instrumentalist Keyboard instruments are sometimes used enhance the fullness the sound Deep Purples Jon Lord played overdriven Hammond organ 1970 John Paul Jones used Moog synthesizer Led Zeppelin III the 1990s almost every subgenre heavy metal synthesizers were used The electric guitar and the sonic power that projects through amplification has historically been the key element heavy metal The heavy metal guitar sound comes from combined use high volumes and heavy distortion For classic heavy metal guitar tone guitarists maintain moderate levels gain moderate levels without excessive preamp pedal distortion retain open spaces and air the music the guitar amplifier turned loud produce the characteristic punch and grind Thrash metal guitar tone has scooped midfrequencies and tightly compressed sound with lots bass frequencies Guitar solos are essential element the heavy metal code that underscores the significance the guitar the genre Most heavy metal songs feature least one guitar solo which primary means through which the heavy metal performer expresses virtuosity Some exceptions are metal and grindcore bands which tend omit guitar solos With rhythm guitar parts the heavy crunch sound heavy metal created palm muting the strings with the picking hand and using distortion Palm muting creates tighter more precise sound and emphasizes the low end The lead role the guitar heavy metal often collides with the traditional frontman bandleader role the vocalist creating musical tension the two contend for dominance spirit affectionate rivalry Heavy metal demands the subordination the voice the overall sound the band Reflecting metals roots the 1960s counterculture explicit display emotion required from the vocals sign authenticity Critic Simon Frith claims that the metal singers tone voice more important than the lyrics The prominent role the bass also key the metal sound and the interplay bass and guitar central element The bass guitar provides the lowend sound crucial making the music heavy The bass plays more important role heavy metal than any other genre rock Metal basslines vary widely complexity from holding down low pedal point foundation doubling complex riffs and licks along with the lead rhythm guitars Some bands feature the bass lead instrument approach popularized Metallicas Cliff Burton with his heavy emphasis bass guitar solos and use chords while playing bass the early 1980s Lemmy Motrhead often played overdriven power chords his bass lines The essence heavy metal drumming creating loud constant beat for the band using the trifecta speed power and precision Heavy metal drumming requires exceptional amount endurance and drummers have develop considerable speed coordination and dexterity play the intricate patterns used heavy metal characteristic metal drumming technique the cymbal choke which consists striking cymbal and then immediately silencing grabbing with the other hand some cases the same striking hand producing burst sound The metal drum setup generally much larger than those employed other forms rock music Black metal death metal and some mainstream metal bands all depend upon doublekicks and blast beats live performance loudnessan onslaught sound sociologist Deena Weinsteins descriptionis considered vital his book Metalheads psychologist Jeffrey Arnett refers heavy metal concerts the sensory equivalent war Following the lead set Jimi Hendrix Cream and The Who early heavy metal acts such Blue Cheer set new benchmarks for volume Blue Cheers Dick Peterson put All knew was wanted more power 1977 review Motrhead concert noted how excessive volume particular figured into the bands impact Weinstein makes the case that the same way that melody the main element pop and rhythm the main focus house music powerful sound timbre and volume are the key elements metal She argues that the loudness designed sweep the listener into the sound and provide shot youthful vitality Heavy metal performers tended almost exclusively male until least the mid1980s apart from exceptions such Girlschool However the 2010s women were making more impact and PopMatters Craig Hayes argues that metal clearly empowers women the subgenres symphonic and power metal there has been sizable number bands that have had women the lead singers bands such Nightwish Delain and Within Temptation have featured women lead singers with men playing instruments The rhythm metal songs emphatic with deliberate stresses Weinstein observes that the wide array sonic effects available metal drummers enables the rhythmic pattern take complexity within its elemental drive and insistency many heavy metal songs the main groove characterized short twonote threenote rhythmic figuresgenerally made 8th 16th notes These rhythmic figures are usually performed with staccato attack created using palmmuted technique the rhythm guitar Brief abrupt and detached rhythmic cells are joined into rhythmic phrases with distinctive often jerky texture These phrases are used create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called riffs which help establish thematic hooks Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such whole note dotted quarter notelength chords slowtempo power ballads The tempos early heavy metal music tended slow even ponderous the late 1970s however metal bands were employing wide variety tempos the 2000s decade metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos quarter note beats per minute extremely fast blast beat tempos quarter note 350 beats per minute One the signatures the genre the guitar power chord technical terms the power chord relatively simple involves just one main interval generally the perfect fifth though octave may added doubling the root When power chords are played the lower strings high volumes and with distortion additional low frequency sounds are created which add the weight the sound and create effect overwhelming power Although the perfect fifth interval the most common basis for the power chord power chords are also based different intervals such the minor third major third perfect fourth diminished fifth minor sixth Most power chords are also played with consistent finger arrangement that can slid easily and down the fretboard Heavy metal usually based riffs created with three main harmonic traits modal scale progressions tritone and chromatic progressions and the use pedal points Traditional heavy metal tends employ modal scales particular the Aeolian and Phrygian modes Harmonically speaking this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such the Aeolian progressions IVIVII IVIIVI IVIIVVII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between and IIII IIIIII IIIVII for example Tensesounding chromatic tritone relationships are used number metal chord progressions addition using modal harmonic relationships heavy metal also uses pentatonic and bluesderived features The tritone interval spanning three whole tonessuch Fwas forbidden dissonance medieval ecclesiastical singing which led monks call diabolus musicathe devil music Heavy metal songs often make extensive use pedal point harmonic basis pedal point sustained tone typically the bass range during which least one foreign dissonant harmony sounded the other parts According Robert Walser heavy metal harmonic relationships are often quite complex and the harmonic analysis done metal players and teachers often very sophisticated the study heavy metal chord structures has been concluded that heavy metal music has proved far more complicated than other music researchers had realized Robert Walser stated that alongside blues and the assemblage disparate musical styles known classical music has been major influence heavy metal since the genres earliest days Also that metals most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music Their appropriation and adaptation classical models sparked the development new kind guitar virtuosity and changes the harmonic and melodic language heavy metal article written for Grove Music Online Walser stated that the 1980s brought the widespread adaptation chord progressions and virtuosic practices from 18thcentury European models especially Bach and Antonio Vivaldi influential guitarists such Ritchie Blackmore Marty Friedman Jason Becker Uli Jon Roth Eddie Van Halen Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen Kurt Bachmann Believer has stated that done correctly metal and classical fit quite well together Classical and metal are probably the two genres that have the most common when comes feel texture creativity Although number metal musicians cite classical composers inspiration classical and metal are rooted different cultural traditions and practicesclassical the art music tradition metal the popular music tradition musicologists Nicolas Cook and Nicola Dibben note Analyses popular music also sometimes reveal the influence art traditions example Walsers linkage heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some the performance practices nineteenthcentury Romanticism However would clearly wrong claim that traditions such blues rock heavy metal rap dance music derive primarily from art music According scholars David Hatch and Stephen Millward Black Sabbath and the numerous heavy metal bands that they inspired have concentrated lyrically dark and depressing subject matter extent hitherto unprecedented any form pop music They take example Sabbaths second album Paranoid 1970 which included songs dealing with personal traumaParanoid and Fairies Wear Boots which described the unsavoury side effects drugtakingas well those confronting wider issues such the selfexplanatory War Pigs and Hand Doom Deriving from the genres roots blues music sex another important topica thread running from Led Zeppelins suggestive lyrics the more explicit references glam metal and metal bands The thematic content heavy metal has long been target criticism According Jon Pareles Heavy metals main subject matter simple and virtually universal With grunts moans and subliterary lyrics celebrates party without limits The bulk the music stylized and formulaic Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal and others have objected what they see advocacy misogyny and the occult During the 1980s the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the Congress regulate the popular music industry due what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics particularly those heavy metal songs Andrew Cope states that claims that heavy metal lyrics are misogynistic are clearly misguided these critics have overlooked the overwhelming evidence that suggests otherwise Music critic Robert Christgau called metal expressive mode that sometimes seems will with for long ordinary white boys fear girls pity themselves and are permitted rage against world theyll never beat Heavy metal artists have had defend their lyrics front the Senate and court 1985 Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider was asked defend his song Under the Blade Senate hearing the hearing the PMRC alleged that the song was about sadomasochism and rape Snider stated that the song was about his bandmates throat surgery 1986 Ozzy Osbourne was sued over the lyrics his song Suicide Solution lawsuit against Osbourne was filed

unsuccessful attempt prosecute the label for obscenity some predominantly Muslim countries heavy metal has been officially denounced threat traditional values countries such Morocco Egypt Lebanon and Malaysia there have been incidents heavy metal musicians and fans being arrested and incarcerated 1997 the Egyptian police jailed many young metal fans and they were accused devil worship and blasphemy after police found metal recordings during searches their homes 2013 Malaysia banned Lamb God from performing their country the grounds that the bands lyrics could interpreted being religiously insensitive and blasphemous Some people considered heavy metal music being leading factor for mental health disorders and thought that heavy metal fans were more likely suffer with poor mental health but study has proven that this not true and the fans this music have lower similar percentage people suffering from poor mental health For many artists and bands visual imagery plays large role heavy metal addition its sound and lyrics heavy metal bands image expressed album cover art logos stage sets clothing design instruments and music videos Downtheback long hair the most crucial distinguishing feature metal fashion Originally adopted from the hippie subculture the 1980s and 1990s heavy metal hair symbolised the hate angst and disenchantment generation that seemingly never felt home according journalist Nader Rahman Long hair gave members the metal community the power they needed rebel against nothing general The classic uniform heavy metal fans consists light

headbanging which involves rhythmically beating time with the head often emphasized long hair The cornuto devil horns hand gesture was popularized vocalist Ronnie James Dio while with Black Sabbath and Dio Although Gene Simmons Kiss claims have been the first make the gesture the 1977 Love Gun album cover there speculation who started the phenomenon Attendees metal concerts not dance the usual sense has been argued that this due the musics largely male audience and extreme heterosexualist ideology Two primary body movements used are headbanging and arm thrust that both sign appreciation and rhythmic gesture The performance air guitar popular among metal fans both concerts and listening records home According Deena Weinstein thrash metal concerts have two elements that are not part the other metal genres moshing and stage diving which were imported from the punkhardcore subculture Weinstein states that moshing participants bump and jostle each other they move circle area called the pit near the stage Stage divers climb onto the stage with the band and then jump back into the audience has been argued that heavy metal has outlasted many other rock genres largely due the emergence intense exclusionary strongly masculine subculture While the metal fan base largely young white male and bluecollar the group tolerant those outside its core demographic base who follow its codes dress appearance and behavior Identification with the subculture strengthened not only the group experience concertgoing and shared elements fashion but also contributing metal magazines and more recently websites Attending live concerts particular has been called the holiest heavy metal communions The metal scene has been characterized subculture alienation with its own code authenticity This code puts several demands performers they must appear both completely devoted their music and loyal the subculture that supports they must appear uninterested mainstream appeal and radio hits and they must never sell out Deena Weinstein states that for the fans themselves the code promotes opposition established authority and separateness from the rest society Musician and filmmaker Rob Zombie observes Most the kids who come shows seem like really imaginative kids with lot creative energy they dont know what with and that metal outsider music for outsiders Nobody wants the weird kid you just somehow end being the weird kid Its kind like that but with metal you have all the weird kids one place Scholars metal have noted the tendency fans classify and reject some performers and some

psychedelic rock scene also known acid rock acid rock was often used interchangeably with heavy metal and hard rock Musicologist Steve Waksman stated that the distinction between acid rock hard rock and heavy metal can some point never more than tenuous while percussionist John Beck defined acid rock synonymous with hard rock and heavy metal Apart from acid rock the terms heavy metal and hard rock have often been used interchangeably particularly discussing bands the 1970s period when the terms were largely synonymous For example the 1983 Rolling Stone Encyclopedia Rock Roll includes this passage known for its aggressive bluesbased hardrock style Aerosmith was the top American heavymetal band the midSeventies Heavy metals quintessential guitar style built around distortionheavy riffs and power chords traces its roots early 1950s Memphis blues guitarists such Joe Hill Louis Willie Johnson and particularly Pat Hare who captured grittier nastier more ferocious electric guitar sound

Got addition The Kinks Dave Davies other guitarists such The Whos Pete Townshend and The Yardbirds Jeff Beck were experimenting with feedback Where the blues rock drumming style started out largely simple shuffle beats small kits drummers began using more muscular complex and amplified approach match and heard against the increasingly loud guitar Vocalists similarly modified their technique and increased their reliance amplification often becoming more stylized and dramatic terms sheer volume especially live performance The Whos biggerlouderwallofMarshalls approach was seminal The

characterized droning guitar riffs amplified feedback and guitar distortion while the 13th Floor Elevators sound particular featured yelping vocals and occasionally demented lyrics Frank Hoffman notes that Psychedelia was sometimes referred acid rock The latter label was applied pounding hard rock variant that evolved out the mid1960s garagepunk movement When rock began turning back softer
