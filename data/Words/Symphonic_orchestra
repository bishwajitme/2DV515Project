orchestra rkstr Italian large instrumental ensemble typical classical music which mixes instruments from different families including bowed string instruments such violin viola cello and double bass well brass woodwinds and percussion instruments each grouped sections Other instruments such the piano and celesta may sometimes appear fifth keyboard section may stand alone may the concert harp and for performances some modern compositions electronic instruments fullsize orchestra may sometimes called symphony orchestra philharmonic orchestra The actual number musicians employed given performance may vary from seventy over one hundred musicians depending the work being played and the size the venue The term chamber orchestra and sometimes concert orchestra usually refers smallersized ensembles about fifty musicians fewercitation needed Orchestras that specialize the Baroque music for example Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel Classical repertoire such that Haydn and Mozart tend smaller than orchestras performing Romantic music repertoirecitation needed such the symphonies Johannes Brahms The typical orchestra grew size throughout the 18th and 19th centuries reaching peak with the large orchestras many 120 players called for the works Richard Wagner and later Gustav Mahler Orchestras are usually led conductor who directs the performance with movements the hands and arms often made easier for the musicians see use conductors baton The conductor unifies the orchestra sets the tempo and shapes the sound the ensemble The conductor also prepares the orchestra leading rehearsals before the public concert which the conductor provides instructions the musicians their interpretation the music being performed The leader the first violin section commonly called the concertmaster also plays important role leading the musicians the Baroque music era 16001750 orchestras were often led the concertmaster chordplaying musician performing the basso continuo parts harpsichord pipe organ tradition that some 20th century and 21st century early music ensembles continue Orchestras play wide range repertoire including symphonies opera and ballet overtures concertos for solo instruments and pit ensembles for operas ballets and some types musical theatre Gilbert and Sullivan operettas Amateur orchestras include those made students from elementary school high school youth orchestras and community orchestras the latter two typically being made amateur musicians from particular city region The term orchestra derives from the Greek orchestra the name for the area front stage ancient Greek theatre reserved for the Greek chorus The typical symphony orchestra consists four groups related musical instruments called the woodwinds brass percussion and strings violin viola cello and double bass Other instruments such the piano and celesta may sometimes grouped into fifth section such keyboard section may stand alone may the concert harp and electric and electronic instruments The orchestra depending the size contains almost all the standard instruments each group the history the orchestra its instrumentation has been expanded over time often agreed have been standardized the classical period and Ludwig van Beethovens influence the classical model the 20th and 21st century new repertory demands expanded the instrumentation the orchestra resulting flexible use the classicalmodel instruments and newly developed electric and electronic instruments various combinations The terms symphony orchestra and philharmonic orchestra may used distinguish different ensembles from the same locality such the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra symphony orchestra will usually have over eighty musicians its roster some cases over hundred but the actual number musicians employed particular performance may vary according the work being played and the size the venue Chamber orchestra usually refers smallersized ensembles major chamber orchestra might employ many fifty musicians some are much smaller than that The term concert orchestra may also used the BBC Concert Orchestra and the Concert Orchestra The socalled standard complement doubled winds and brass the orchestra from the first half the 19th century generally attributed the forces called for Beethovencitation needed The composers instrumentation almost always included paired flutes oboes clarinets bassoons horns and trumpets The exceptions this are his Symphony Violin Concerto and Piano Concerto which each specify single flute Beethoven carefully calculated the expansion this particular timbral palette Symphonies and for innovative effect The third horn the Eroica Symphony arrives provide not only some harmonic flexibility but also the effect choral brass the Trio movement Piccolo contrabassoon and trombones add the triumphal finale his Symphony piccolo and pair trombones help deliver the effect storm and sunshine the Sixth also known the Pastoral Symphony The Ninth asks for second pair horns for reasons similar the Eroica four horns has since become standard Beethovens use piccolo contrabassoon trombones and untuned percussionplus chorus and vocal soloistsin his finale are his earliest suggestion that the timbral boundaries symphony might expanded For several decades after his death symphonic instrumentation was faithful Beethovens wellestablished model with few exceptionscitation needed Apart from the core orchestral complement various other instruments are called for occasionally These include the flugelhorn and cornet Saxophones and classical guitars for example appear some 19th through 21stcentury scores While appearing only featured solo instruments some works for example Maurice Ravels orchestration Modest Mussorgskys Pictures Exhibition and Sergei Rachmaninoffs Symphonic Dances the saxophone included other works such Ravels Bolro Sergei Prokofievs Romeo and Juliet Suites and Vaughan Williams Symphonies No6 and and William Waltons Belshazzars Feast and many other works member the orchestral ensemble The euphonium featured few late Romantic and 20thcentury works usually playing parts marked tenor tuba including Gustav Holsts The Planets and Richard Strausss Ein Heldenleben The Wagner tuba modified member the horn family appears Richard Wagners cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen and several other works Strauss Bla Bartk and others has prominent role Anton Bruckners Symphony Major Cornets appear Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovskys ballet Swan Lake Claude Debussys Mer and several orchestral works Hector Berlioz Unless these instruments are played members doubling another instrument for example trombone player changing euphonium bassoon player switching contrabassoon for certain passage orchestras typically hire freelance musicians augment their regular ensemble The 20thcentury orchestra was far more flexible than its predecessors Beethovens and Felix Mendelssohns time the orchestra was composed fairly standard core instruments which was very rarely modified composers time progressed and the Romantic period saw changes accepted modification with composers such Berlioz and Mahler some composers used multiple harps and sound effect such the wind machine During the 20th century the modern orchestra was generally standardized with the modern instrumentation listed below Nevertheless the mid late 20th century with the development contemporary classical music instrumentation could practically handpicked the composer add electric instruments such electric guitar electronic instruments such synthesizers nonWestern instruments other instruments not traditionally used orchestra With this history mind the orchestra can analysed five periods the Baroque era the Classical music period earlymidRomantic music era lateRomanticearly 20th century music and 21st century era The first Baroque orchestra Bach Handel Vivaldi which generally had smaller number performers and which one more chordplaying instruments the basso continuo group harpsichord pipe organ and assorted bass instruments perform the bassline played important role the second typical classical period orchestra early Beethoven along with Mozart and Haydn which used smaller group performers than Romantic music orchestra and fairly standardized instrumentation the third typical earlymidRomantic era Schubert Berlioz Schumann the fourth lateRomanticearly 20th century orchestra Wagner Brahms Mahler Stravinsky the common complement 2010era modern orchestra Adams Barber Aaron Copland Glass Penderecki Among the instrument groups and within each group instruments there generally accepted hierarchy Every instrumental group section has principal who generally responsible for leading the group and playing orchestral solos The violins are divided into two groups first violin and second violin with the second violins playing lower registers than the first violins playing accompaniment part harmonizing the melody played the first violins The principal first violin called the concertmaster leader the and not only considered the leader the string section but the secondincommand the entire orchestra behind only the conductor The concertmaster leads the preconcert tuning and handles musical aspects orchestra management such determining the bowings for the violins for all the string section The concertmaster usually sits the conductors left closest the audience There also principal second violin principal viola principal cello and principal bass The principal trombone considered the leader the low brass section while the principal trumpet generally considered the leader the entire brass section While the oboe often provides the tuning note for the orchestra due 300yearold convention principal the leader the woodwind section though woodwind ensembles often the flute leader Instead each principal confers with the others equals the case musical differences opinion Most sections also have assistant principal coprincipal associate principal the case the first violins assistant concertmaster who often plays tutti part addition replacing the principal his her absence section string player plays unison with the rest the section except the case divided divisi parts where upper and lower parts the music are often assigned outside nearer the audience and inside seated players Where solo part called for string section the section leader invariably plays that part The section leader principal string section also responsible for determining the bowings often based the bowings set out the concertmaster some cases the principal string section may use slightly different bowing than the concertmaster accommodate the requirements playing their instrument the doublebass section Principals string section will also lead entrances for their section typically lifting the bow before the entrance ensure the section plays together Tutti wind and brass players generally play unique but nonsolo part Section percussionists play parts assigned them the principal percussionist modern times the musicians are usually directed conductor although early orchestras did not have one giving this role instead the concertmaster the harpsichordist playing the continuo Some modern orchestras also without conductors particularly smaller orchestras and those specializing historically accurate socalled period performances baroque and earlier music The most frequently performed repertoire for symphony orchestra Western classical music opera However orchestras are used sometimes popular music accompany rock pop band concert extensively film music and increasingly often video game music Orchestras are also used the symphonic metal genre The term orchestra can also applied jazz ensemble for example the performance bigband music the 2000s all tenured members professional orchestra normally audition for positions the ensemble Performers typically play one more solo pieces the auditionees choice such movement concerto solo Bach movement and variety excerpts from the orchestral literature that are advertised the audition poster the auditionees can prepare The excerpts are typically the most technically challenging parts and solos from the orchestral literature Orchestral auditions are typically held front panel that includes the conductor the concertmaster the principal player the section for which the auditionee applying and possibly other principal players and regular orchestra members The most promising candidates from the first round auditions are invited return for second third round auditions which allows the conductor and the panel compare the best candidates Performers may asked sight read orchestral music The final stage the audition process some orchestras test week which the performer plays with the orchestra for week two which allows the conductor and principal players see the individual can function well actual rehearsal and performance setting There are range different employment arrangements The most soughtafter positions are permanent tenured positions the orchestra Orchestras also hire musicians contracts ranging length from single concert full season more Contract performers may hired for individual concerts when the orchestra doing exceptionally large lateRomantic era orchestral work substitute for permanent member who sick professional musician who hired perform for single concert sometimes called sub Some contract musicians may hired replace permanent members for the period that the permanent member parental leave disability leave Historically major professional orchestras have been mostly entirely composed male musicians The first female members hired professional orchestras have been harpists The Vienna Philharmonic for example did not accept women permanent membership until 1997 far later than comparable orchestras the other orchestras ranked among the worlds top five Gramophone 2008 The last major orchestra appoint woman permanent position was the Berlin Philharmonic February 1996 the Vienna Philharmonics principal flute Dieter Flury told Westdeutscher Rundfunk that accepting women would gambling with the emotional unity emotionelle Geschlossenheit that this organism currently has April 1996 the orchestras press secretary wrote that compensating for the expected leaves absence maternity leave would problem 1997 the Vienna Philharmonic was facing protests during tour the National Organization for Women and the International Alliance for Women Music Finally after being held increasing ridicule even socially conservative Austria members the orchestra gathered February 1997 extraordinary meeting the eve their departure and agreed admit woman Anna Lelkes harpist 2013 the orchestra has six female members one them violinist Albena Danailova became one the orchestras concertmasters 2008 the first woman hold that position 2012 women made the orchestras membership VPO president Clemens Hellsberg said the VPO now uses completely screened blind auditions 2013 article Mother Jones stated that while many prestigious orchestras have significant female membershipwomen outnumber men the New York Philharmonics violin sectionand several renowned ensembles including the National Symphony Orchestra the Detroit Symphony and the Minnesota Symphony are led women violinists the double bass brass and percussion sections major orchestras are still predominantly male 2014 BBC article stated that the introduction blind auditions where prospective instrumentalist performs behind screen that the judging panel can exercise gender racial prejudice has seen the gender balance traditionally maledominated symphony orchestras gradually shift There are also variety amateur orchestras Orchestras play wide range repertoire ranging from 17thcentury dance suites 18th century divertimentos 20th century film scores and 21stcentury symphonies Orchestras have become synonymous with the symphony extended musical composition Western classical music that typically contains multiple movements which provide contrasting keys and tempos Symphonies are notated musical score which contains all the instrument parts The conductor uses the score study the symphony before rehearsals and decide their interpretation tempos articulation phrasing etc and follow the music during rehearsals and concerts while leading the ensemble Orchestral musicians play from parts containing just the notated music for their instrument small number symphonies also contain vocal parts Beethovens Ninth Symphony Orchestras also perform overtures term originally applied the instrumental introduction opera During the early Romantic era composers such Beethoven and Mendelssohn began use the term refer independent selfexisting instrumental programmatic works that presaged genres such the symphonic poem form devised Franz Liszt several works that began dramatic overtures These were first undoubtedly intended played the head programme the 1850s the concert overture began supplanted the symphonic poem Orchestras also play with instrumental soloists concertos During concertos the orchestra plays accompaniment role the soloist solo violinist pianist and times introduces musical themes interludes while the soloist not playing Orchestras also play during operas ballets some musical theatre works and some choral works both sacred works such Masses and secular works operas and ballets the orchestra accompanies the singers and dancers respectively and plays overtures and interludes where the melodies played the orchestra take centre stage the Baroque era orchestras performed range venues including the fine houses aristocrats opera halls and churches Some wealthy aristocrats had orchestra residence their estate entertain them and their guests with performances During the Classical era composers increasing sought out financial support from the general public orchestra concerts were increasingly held public concert halls where music lovers could buy tickets hear the orchestra course aristocratic patronage orchestras continued during the Classical era but this went alongside public concerts the 20th and 21st century orchestras found new patron governments Many orchestras North America and Europe receive part their funding from national regional level governments state governments the city governments These government subsidies make part orchestra revenue along with ticket sales charitable donations the orchestra registered charity and other fundraising activities With the invention successive technologies including sound recording radio broadcasting television broadcasting and Internetbased streaming and downloading concert videos orchestras have been able find new revenue sources One the great unmentionable topics orchestral playing faking the process which orchestral musician gives the impression playing every note written typically for very challenging passage that very high very fast while not actually playing the notes that are the printed music part article The Strad states that all orchestral musicians even those the top orchestras occasionally fake certain passages One reason that musicians fake because there are not enough rehearsals Another factor the extreme challenges 20th century and 21st century contemporary pieces professionals interviewed the magazine said faking was necessary anything from ten almost ninety per cent some modern works Professional players who were interviewed were consensus that faking may acceptable when part not written well for the instrument but faking just because you havent practised the music not acceptable The invention the piston and rotary valve Heinrich Stlzel and Friedrich Blhmel both Silesians 1815 was the first series innovations which impacted the orchestra including the development modern keywork for the flute Theobald Boehm and the innovations Adolphe Sax the woodwinds notably the invention the saxophone These advances would lead Hector Berlioz write landmark book instrumentation which was the first systematic treatise the use instrumental sound expressive element music The next major expansion symphonic practice came from Richard Wagners Bayreuth orchestra founded accompany his musical dramas Wagners works for the stage were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity indeed his score Das Rheingold calls for six harps Thus Wagner envisioned evermoredemanding role for the conductor the theatre orchestra elaborated his influential work Conducting This brought about revolution orchestral composition and set the style for orchestral performance for the next eighty years Wagners theories reexamined the importance tempo dynamics bowing string instruments and the role principals the orchestra Conductors who studied his methods would influential themselvesvague the early 20thcentury dawned symphony orchestras were larger better funded and better trained than ever before consequently composers could compose larger and more ambitious works The influence Gustav Mahler was particularly innovational his later symphonies such the mammoth Symphony No8 Mahler pushes the furthest boundaries orchestral size employing huge forces the late Romantic era orchestras could support the most enormous forms symphonic expression with huge string sections massive brass sections and expanded range percussion instruments With the recording era beginning the standards performance were pushed new level because recorded symphony could listened closely and even minor errors intonation ensemble which might not noticeable live performance could heard critics recording technologies improved over the 20th and 21st centuries eventually small errors recording could fixed audio editing overdubbing Some older conductors and composers could remember time when simply getting through the music best possible was the standard Combined with the wider audience made possible recording this led renewed focus particular star conductors and high standard orchestral execution With the advent the early music movement smaller orchestras where players worked execution works styles derived from the study older treatises playing became common These include the Orchestra the Age Enlightenment the London Classical Players under the direction Sir Roger Norrington and the Academy Ancient Music under Christopher Hogwood among otherscitation needed the United States the late 20th century saw crisis funding and support for orchestras The size and cost symphony orchestra compared the size the base supporters became issue that struck the core the institution Few orchestras could fill auditoriums and the timehonored seasonsubscription system became increasingly anachronistic more and more listeners would buy tickets hoc basis for individual events Orchestral endowments andmore centrally the daily operation American orchestrasorchestral donors have seen investment portfolios shrink produce lower yields reducing the ability donors contribute further there has been trend toward donors finding other social causes more compelling Also while government funding less central American than European orchestras cuts such funding are still significant for American ensembles Finally the drastic fallingoff revenues from recording tied small extent changes the recording industry itself began period change that has yet reach its conclusion orchestras that have gone into Chapter bankruptcy include the Philadelphia Orchestra April 2011 and the Louisville Orchestra December 2010 orchestras that have gone into Chapter bankruptcy and have ceased operations include the Northwest Chamber Orchestra 2006 the Honolulu Orchestra March 2011 the New Mexico Symphony Orchestra April 2011 and the Syracuse Symphony June 2011 The Festival Orchestras Orlando Florida ceased operations the end March 2011 One source financial difficulties that received notice and criticism was high salaries for music directors orchestras which led several highprofile conductors take pay cuts recent years Music administrators such Michael Tilson Thomas and EsaPekka Salonen argued that new music new means presenting and renewed relationship with the community could revitalize the symphony orchestra The American critic Greg Sandow has argued detail that orchestras must revise their approach music performance the concert experience marketing public relations community involvement and presentation bring them line with the expectations 21stcentury audiences immersed popular culture not uncommon for contemporary composers use unconventional instruments including various synthesizers achieve desired effects Many however find more conventional orchestral configuration provide better possibilities for color and depth Composers like John Adams often employ Romanticsize orchestras Adams opera Nixon China Philip Glass and others may more free yet still identify sizeboundaries Glass particular has recently turned conventional orchestras works like the Concerto for Cello and Orchestra and the Violin Concerto Along with decrease funding some orchestras have reduced their overall personnel well the number players appearing performances The reduced numbers performance are usually confined the string section since the numbers here have traditionally been flexible multiple players typically play from the same part Conducting the art directing musical performance such orchestral choral concert The primary duties the conductor are set the tempo ensure correct entries various members the ensemble and shape the phrasing where appropriate convey their ideas and interpretation conductor communicates with their musicians primarily through hand gestures typically though not invariably with the aid baton and may use other gestures signals such eye contact with relevant performers conductors directions will almost invariably supplemented reinforced verbal instructions suggestions their musicians rehearsal prior performance The conductor typically stands raised podium with large music stand for the full score which contains the musical notation for all the instruments and voices Since the mid18th century most conductors have not played instrument when conductingcitation needed although earlier periods classical music history leading ensemble while playing instrument was common Baroque music from the 1600s the 1750s the group would typically led the harpsichordist first violinist see concertmaster approach that modern times has been revived several music directors for music from this period Conducting while playing piano synthesizer may also done with musical theatre pit orchestras Communication typically nonverbal during performance this strictly the case art music but jazz big bands large pop ensembles there may occasional spoken instructions such count However rehearsals frequent interruptions allow the conductor give verbal directions how the music should played sung Conductors act guides the orchestras choirs they conduct They choose the works performed and study their scores which they may make certain adjustments regarding tempo articulation phrasing repetitions sections and work out their interpretation and relay their vision the performers They may also attend organizational matters such scheduling rehearsals planning concert season hearing auditions and selecting members and promoting their ensemble the media Orchestras choirs concert bands and other sizable musical ensembles such big bands are usually led conductors the Baroque music era 16001750 most orchestras were led one the musicians typically the principal first violin called the concertmaster The concertmaster would lead the tempo pieces lifting his her bow rhythmic manner Leadership might also provided one the chordplaying instrumentalists playing the basso continuo part which was the core most Baroque instrumental ensemble pieces Typically this would harpsichord player pipe organist luteist theorbo player keyboard player could lead the ensemble with his her head taking one the hands off the keyboard lead more difficult tempo change lutenist theorbo player could lead lifting the instrument neck and down indicate the tempo piece lead ritard during cadence ending some works which combined choirs and instrumental ensembles two leaders were sometimes used concertmaster lead the instrumentalists and chordplaying performer lead the singers During the Classical music period 17201800 the practice using chordal instruments play basso continuo was gradually phased out and disappeared completely 1800 Instead ensembles began use conductors lead the orchestras tempos and playing style while the concertmaster played additional leadership role for the musicians especially the string players who imitate the bowstroke and playing style the concertmaster the degree that feasible for the different stringed instruments 1922 the idea conductorless orchestra was revived postrevolutionary Soviet Union The symphony orchestra Persimfans was formed without conductor because the founders believed that the ensemble should modeled the ideal Marxist state which all people are equal such its members felt that there was need led the dictatorial baton conductor instead they were led committee which determined tempos and playing styles Although was partial success within the Soviet Union the principal difficulty with the concept was changing tempo during performances because even the committee had issued decree about where tempo change should take place there was leader the ensemble guide this tempo change The orchestra survived for ten years before Stalins cultural politics disbanded taking away its funding Western nations some ensembles such the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra based New York City have had more success with conductorless orchestras although decisions are likely deferred some sense leadership within the ensemble for example the principal wind and string players notably the concertmaster Others have returned the tradition principal player usually violinist being the artistic director and running rehearsal and leading concerts Examples include the Australian Chamber Orchestra Amsterdam Sinfonietta Candida Thompson and the New Century Chamber Orchestra well part the early music movement some 20th and 21st century orchestras have revived the Baroque practice having conductor the podium for Baroque pieces using the concertmaster chordplaying basso continuo performer harpsichord organ lead the group Some orchestral works specify that offstage trumpet should used that other instruments from the orchestra should positioned offstage behind the stage create haunted mystical effect ensure that the offstage instrumentalists play time sometimes subconductor will stationed offstage with clear view the principal conductor Examples include the ending Neptune from Gustav Holsts The Planets The principal conductor leads the large orchestra and the subconductor relays the principal conductors tempo and gestures the offstage musician musicians One the challenges with using two conductors that the second conductor may get out synchronization with the main conductor may misconvey misunderstand the principal conductors gestures which can lead the offstage instruments being out time the late 20th century and early 21st century some orchestras use video camera pointed the principal conductor and closedcircuit set front the offstage performers instead using two conductors The techniques polystylism and polytempo music have led few 20th and 21st century composers write music where multiple orchestras ensembles perform simultaneously These trends have brought about the phenomenon polyconductor music wherein separate subconductors conduct each group musicians Usually one principal conductor conducts the subconductors thereby shaping the overall performance Percy Graingers The Warriors which includes three conductors the primary conductor the orchestra secondary conductor directing offstage brass ensemble and tertiary conductor directing percussion and harp One example the late century orchestral music Karlheinz Stockhausens Gruppen for three orchestras which are placed around the audience This way the sound masses could spacialized electroacoustic work Gruppen was premiered Cologne 1958 conducted Stockhausen Bruno Maderna and Pierre Boulez has beenwhen performed Simon Rattle John Carewe and Daniel Harding
