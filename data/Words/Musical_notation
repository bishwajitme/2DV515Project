Music notation musical notation any system used visually represent aurally perceived music played with instruments sung the human voice through the use written printed otherwiseproduced symbols Types and methods notation have varied between cultures and throughout history and much information about ancient music notation fragmentary Even the same time period such the 2010s different styles music and different cultures use different music notation methods for example for professional classical music performers sheet music using staves and noteheads the most common way notating music but for professional country music session musicians the Nashville Number System the main method The symbols used include ancient symbols and modern symbols made upon any media such symbols cut into stone made clay tablets made using pen papyrus parchment manuscript paper printed using printing press 1400s computer printer 1980s other printing modern copying technology Although many ancient cultures used symbols represent melodies and rhythms none them were particularly comprehensive and this has limited todays understanding their music The seeds what would eventually become modern western notation were sown medieval Europe starting with the Catholic Churchs goal for ecclesiastical uniformity The church began notating plainchant melodies that the same chants could used throughout the church Music notation developed further the Renaissance and Baroque music eras the classical period 17501820 and the Romantic music era 18201900 notation continued develop new musical instrument technologies were developed the contemporary classical music the 20th and 21st century music notation has continued develop with the introduction graphical notation some modern composers and the use since the 1980s computerbased score writer programs for notating music Music notation has been adapted many kinds music including classical music popular music and traditional music The earliest form musical notation can found cuneiform tablet that was created Nippur Sumer todays Iraq about 1400 The tablet represents fragmentary instructions for performing music that the music was composed harmonies thirds and that was written using diatonic scale tablet from about 1250 shows more developed form notation Although the interpretation the notation system still controversial clear that the notation indicates the names strings lyre the tuning which described other tablets Although they are fragmentary these tablets represent the earliest notated melodies found anywhere the world Ancient Greek musical notation was use from least the 6th century until approximately the 4th century several complete compositions and fragments compositions using this notation survive The notation consists symbols placed above text syllables example complete composition the Seikilos epitaph which has been variously dated between the 2nd century the 1st century Three hymns Mesomedes Crete exist manuscript The Delphic Hymns dated the 2nd century also use this notation but they are not completely preserved Ancient Greek notation appears have fallen out use around the time the Decline the Western Roman Empire Byzantine music has mainly survived music for court ceremonies including vocal religious music not known based the monodic modal singing and instrumental music Ancient Greece Greek theoretical categories played key role understand and transmit Byzantine music especially the tradition Damascus had strong impact the preIslamic Near East comparable Persian music Unlike Western notation Byzantine neumes always indicate modal steps relation clef modal key modal signatures which had been use since papyrus fragments dating back the 6th century Originally this key the incipit common melody was enough indicate certain melodic model given within the echos Despite ekphonetic notation further early melodic notation developed not earlier than between the 9th and the 10th century Like the Greek alphabet notational signs are ordered left right though the direction could adapted like certain Syriac manuscripts The question rhythm was entirely based cheironomia wellknown melodical phrases given gestures the choirleaders which existed once part oral tradition Today the main difference between Western and Eastern neumes that Eastern notation symbols are differential rather than absolute they indicate pitch steps rising falling the same step and the musicians know deduce correctly from the score and the note they are singing presently which correct interval meant These step symbols themselves better phonic neumes resemble brush strokes and are colloquially called gntzoi hooks Modern Greek Notes pitch classes modal keys usually memorised modal signatures are represented written form only between these neumes manuscripts usually written red ink modern notation they simply serve optional reminder and modal and tempo directions have been added necessary Papadic notation medial signatures usually meant temporary change into another echos The socalled great signs were once related cheironomic signs according modern interpretations they are understood embellishments and microtonal attractions pitch changes smaller than semitone both essential Byzantine chant Since Chrysanthos Madytos there are seven standard note names used for solfge parallag while the older practice still used the four enechemata intonation formulas the four echoi given the modal signatures the authentic kyrioi ascending direction and the plagal plagioi descending direction Papadic Octoechos With exception and they roughly correspond Western solmization syllables sol Byzantine music uses the eight natural nontempered scales whose elements were identified khoi sounds exclusively and therefore the absolute pitch each note may slightly vary each time depending the particular khos used Byzantine notation still used many Orthodox Churches Sometimes cantors also use transcriptions into Western Kievan staff notation while adding nonnotatable embellishment material from memory and sliding into the natural scales from experience but even concerning modern neume editions since the reform Chrysanthos lot details are only known from oral tradition related traditional masters and their experience 1252 Safi alDin alUrmawi developed form musical notation where rhythms were represented geometric representation Many subsequent scholars rhythm have sought develop graphical geometrical notations For example similar geometric system was published 1987 Kjell Gustafson whose method represents rhythm twodimensional graph The scholar and music theorist Isidore Seville while writing the early 7th century considered that unless sounds are held the memory man they perish because they cannot written down the middle the 9th century however form neumatic notation began develop monasteries Europe mnemonic device for Gregorian chant using symbols known neumes the earliest surviving musical notation this type the Musica disciplina Aurelian Rme from about 850 There are scattered survivals from the Iberian Peninsula before this time type notation known Visigothic neumes but its few surviving fragments have not yet been deciphered The problem with this notation was that only showed melodic contours and consequently the music could not read someone who did not know the music already Notation had developed far enough notate melody but there was still system for notating rhythm mid13thcentury treatise Mensurabili Musica explains set six rhythmic modes that were use the time although not clear how they were formed These rhythmic modes were all triple time and rather limited rhythm chant six different repeating patterns This was flaw seen German music theorist Franco Cologne and summarised part his treatise Ars cantus mensurabilis the art measured chant mensural notation suggested that individual notes could have their own rhythms represented the shape the note Not until the 14th century did something like the present system fixed note lengths arisecitation needed The use regular measures bars became commonplace the end the 17th centurycitation needed The founder what now considered the standard music stave was Guido dArezzo Italian Benedictine monk who lived from about 991 until after 1033 taught the use solmization syllables based hymn Saint John the Baptist which begins Queant Laxis and was written the Lombard historian Paul the Deacon The first stanza Guido used the first syllable each line Sol and read notated music terms hexachords they were not note names and each could depending context applied any note the 17th century was changed most countries except France the easily singable open syllable said have been taken from the name the Italian theorist Giovanni Battista Donibut rather have been taken from the word Dominus Latin with the meaning the Lord Catholic monks developed the first forms modern European musical notation order standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church and enormous body religious music has been composed for through the ages This led directly the emergence and development European classical music and its many derivatives The Baroque style which encompassed music art and architecture was particularly encouraged the postReformation Catholic Church such forms offered means religious expression that was stirring and emotional intended stimulate religious fervor Modern music notation used musicians many different genres throughout the world The staff acts framework upon which pitches are indicated placing oval noteheads the staff lines between the lines The pitch the oval musical noteheads can modified accidentals The duration note length shown with different note values which can indicated the notehead being stemless hollow oval whole note hollow rectangle double whole note stemmed hollow oval half note solid oval using stems indicate quarter notes and stems with added flags beams indicate smaller subdivisions and additional symbols such dots and ties which lengthen the duration note Notation read from left right which makes setting music for righttoleft scripts difficult staff stave British English written music generally begins with clef which indicates the position one particular note the staff The treble clef clef was originally letter and identifies the second line the five line staff the note above middle The bass clef clef shows the position the note below middle While the treble and bass clef are the most widely used clefs other clefs are used such the alto clef used for viola and alto trombone music and the tenor clef used for some cello and double bass music Notes representing pitch outside the scope the five line staff can represented using ledger lines which provide single note with additional lines and spaces Some instruments use mainly one clef such violin and flute which use treble clef and double bass and tuba which use bass clef Some instruments regularly use both clefs such piano and pipe organ Following the clef the key signature staff indicates the key the piece song specifying that certain notes are flat sharp throughout the piece unless otherwise indicated with accidentals added before certain notes When sharp placed before note this makes that note one semitone higher When flat placed before note this makes that note one semitone lower Double sharps and double flats are less common but they are used double sharp placed before note make two semitones higher double flat placed before note make two semitones lower natural sign placed before note renders that note its natural form which means that any sharps flats applying that note from the key signature from accidentals are cancelled Sometimes courtesy accidental used music where not technically required remind the musician what pitch the key signature requires Following the key signature the time signature The time signature typically consists two numbers with one the most common being The top indicates that there are four beats per measure also called bar The bottom indicates that each those beats are quarter notes Measures divide the piece into groups beats and the time signatures specify those groupings used often that also called common time and may indicated with rather than numbers Other common time signatures are three beats per bar with each beat being quarter note two beats per bar with each beat being quarter note six beats per bar with each beat being eighth note and 128 twelve beats per bar with each beat being eighth note practice the eighth notes are typically put into four groups three eighth notes 128 compound time type time signature Many other time signatures exist such and Many short classical music pieces from the classical era and songs from traditional music and popular music are one time signature for much all the piece Music from the Romantic music era and later particularly contemporary classical music and rock music genres such progressive rock and the hardcore punk subgenre mathcore may use mixed meter songs pieces change from one meter another for example alternating between bars and Directions the player regarding matters such tempo Allegro Andante Largo Vif Lent Modrment Presto etc dynamics pianississimo pianissimo piano mezzopiano mezzoforte forte fortissimo fortississimo etc appear above below the staff Terms indicating the musical expression feel song piece are indicated the beginning the piece and any points where the mood changes Slow March Fast Swing Medium Blues Fougueux Feierlich Gelassen Piacevole Con slancio Majestic Hostile etc For vocal music lyrics are written near the pitches the melody For short pauses breaths retakes retakes are indicated with mark are added music for ensembles score shows music for all players together with the staves for the different instruments andor voices stacked vertically The conductor uses the score while she leads orchestra concert band choir other large ensemble Individual performers ensemble play from parts which contain only the music played individual musician score can constructed from complete set parts and vice versa The process was laborious and time consuming when parts were handcopied from the score but since the development scorewriter computer software the 1980s score stored electronically can have parts automatically prepared the program and quickly and inexpensively printed out using computer printer music lowers pitch down one semitone music raises note one semitone For example sharp would raise while flat would lower Jeongganbo unique traditional musical notation system created during the time Sejong the Great that was the first East Asian system represent rhythm pitch and time Among various kinds Korean traditional music Jeongganbo targets particular genre Jeongak Jeongganbo tells the pitch writing the pitchs name down box called jeonggan this where the name comes from One jeonggan one beat each and can split into two three more hold half beats and quarter beats and more This makes easy for the reader figure out the beat Also there are lots markings indicating things such ornaments Most these were later created Kisu Kim The Indian scholar and musical theorist Pingala 200 his Chanda Sutra used marks indicating long and short syllables indicate meters Sanskrit poetry the notation Indian rga solfegelike system called sargam used Western solfege there are names for the seven basic pitches major scale Shadaj Rishabh Gandhar Madhyam Pancham Dhaivat and Nishad usually shortened Dha The tonic any scale named and the dominant fixed any scale and fixed fifth above Pythagorean fifth rather than equaltempered

systems exist for nontwelvetone equal temperament and nonWestern music such the Indian Swaralipi Znamenny Chant singing tradition used the Russian Orthodox Church which uses hook and banner notation Znamenny Chant unison melismatic liturgical singing that has its own specific notation called the stolp notation The symbols used the stolp notation are called kryuki Russian hooks znamena Russian signs Often the names the signs are used refer the stolp notation Znamenny melodies are part system consisting Eight Modes intonation structures called glasy the melodies are characterized fluency and wellbalancednessKholopov 2003 192 There exist several types Znamenny Chant the socalled Stolpovoy Malyj Little and Bolshoy Great Znamenny Chant Ruthenian Chant Prostopinije sometimes considered subdivision the Znamenny Chant tradition with the Muscovite Chant Znamenny Chant proper being the second branch the same musical continuum Znamenny Chants are not written with notes the socalled linear notation but with special signs called Znamna Russian for marks banners Kryuki hooks some shapes these signs resemble hooks Each sign may include the following components large black hook black stroke several smaller black points and commas and lines near the hook crossing the hook Some signs may mean only one note some notes and some whole melody more than notes with complicated rhythmic structure The stolp notation was developed Kievan Rus East Slavic refinement the Byzantine neumatic musical notation The most notable feature this notation system that records transitions the melody rather than notes The signs also represent mood and gradation how this part melody sung tempo strength devotion meekness etc Every sign has its own name and also features spiritual symbol For example there specific sign called little dove Russian golubchik which represents two rising sounds but which also symbol the Holy Ghost Gradually the system became more and more complicated This system was also ambiguous that almost one except the most trained and educated singers could sing unknown melody sight The signs only helped reproduce the melody not coding unambiguous waySee Byzantine Empire The earliest known examples text referring music China are inscriptions musical instruments found the Tomb Marquis Zeng 433 Sets chimestones and bells bore lengthy inscriptions concerning pitches scales and transposition The bells still sound the pitches that their inscriptions refer Although notated musical compositions were found the inscriptions indicate that the system was sufficiently advanced allow for musical notation Two systems pitch nomenclature existed one for relative pitch and one for absolute pitch For relative pitch solmization system was used Gongche notation used Chinese characters for the names the scale Japanese music highly diversified and therefore requires various systems notation Japanese shakuhachi music for example glissandos and timbres are often more significant than distinct pitches whereas taiko notation focuses discrete strokes Ryukyuan sanshin music uses kunkunshi notation system kanji with each character corresponding finger position particular string Notation plays relatively minor role the oral traditions Indonesia However Java and Bali several systems were devised beginning the end the 19th century initially for archival purposes Today the most widespread are cipher notations not angka the broadest sense which the pitches are represented with some subset the numbers with corresponding either highest note particular octave Sundanese gamelan lowest the kepatihan notation Javanese gamelan Notes the ranges outside the central octave are represented with one more dots above below the each number For the most part these cipher notations are mainly used notate the skeletal melody the balungan and vocal parts gerongan although transcriptions the elaborating instrument variations are sometimes used for analysis and teaching Drum parts are notated with system symbols largely based letters representing the vocables used learn and remember drumming patterns these symbols are typically laid out grid underneath the skeletal melody for specific generic piece The symbols used for drum notation well the vocables represented are highly variable from place place and performer performer addition these current systems two older notations used kind staff the Solonese script could capture the flexible rhythms the pesinden with squiggle horizontal staff while Yogyakarta ladderlike vertical staff allowed notation the balungan dots and also included important drum strokes Bali there are few books published Gamelan gender wayang pieces employing alphabetical notation the old Balinese script Composers and scholars both Indonesian and foreign have also mapped the slendro and pelog tuning systems gamelan onto the western staff with and without various symbols for microtones The Dutch composer Ton Leeuw also invented three line staff for his composition Gending However these systems not enjoy widespread use the second half the twentieth century Indonesian musicians and scholars extended cipher notation other oral traditions and diatonic scale cipher notation has become common for notating westernrelated genres church hymns popular songs and forth Unlike the cipher notation for gamelan music which uses fixed that always corresponds the same pitch within the natural variability gamelan tuning Indonesian diatonic cipher notation moveableDo notation scores must indicate which pitch corresponds the number for example short melody slendro notated using the Surakarta method The same notated using the Yogyakarta method chequered notation The same notated using Kepatihan notation The same approximated using Western notation Playhelpinfo pitch bracket notation music written with melody lines and pitch brackets Melody lines are like staff lines except they can change pitch writing pitch brackets them Pitch brackets add subtract scale steps the melody line The shape the bracket angle bracket determines the number scale steps add The direction the bracket opening closing determines whether add subtract scale steps result the mathematical nature pitch bracket notation arithmetic and algebra can directly applied the notation Musical variations can mathematically generated from their themes Cipher notation systems assigning Arabic numerals the major scale degrees have been used least since the Iberian organ tablatures the 16thcentury and include such exotic adaptations Siffernotskrift The one most widely use today the Chinese Jianpu discussed the main article Numerals can course also assigned different scale systems the Javanese kepatihan notation described above Solfge way assigning syllables names the musical scale order they are today Sol for the octave The classic variation Sol The first Western system functional names for the musical notes was introduced Guido Arezzo 991 after 1033 using the beginning syllables the first six musical lines the Latin hymn queant laxis The original sequence was Sol where each verse started scale note higher later became The equivalent syllables used Indian music are Dha See also solfge sargam Kodly hand signs Tonic solfa type notation using the initial letters solfge The notes the 12tone scale can written their letter names possibly with trailing sharp flat symbol such Tablature was first used the Middle Ages for organ music and later the Renaissance for lute music most lute tablatures staff used but instead pitch values the lines the staff represent the strings the instrument The frets finger are written each line indicated letters numbers Rhythm written separately with one another variation standard note values indicating the duration the fastest moving part Few seem have remarked the fact that tablature combines one notation system both the physical and technical requirements play the lines and symbols them and relation each other representing the actual performance actions with the unfolding the music itself the lines tablature taken horizontally represent the actual temporal unfolding the music later periods lute and guitar music was written with standard notation Tablature caught interest again the late 20th century for popular guitar music and other fretted instruments being easy transcribe and share over the internet ASCII format Websites like OLGA have archives textbased popular music tablature Klavarskribo sometimes shortened klavar music notation system that was introduced 1931 the Dutchman Cornelis Pot The name means keyboard writing Esperanto differs from conventional music notation number ways and intended easily readable Many klavar readers are from the Netherlands Some chromatic systems have been created taking advantage the layout black and white keys the standard piano keyboard The staff most widely referred piano roll created extending the black and white piano keys Over the past three centuries hundreds music notation systems have been proposed alternatives traditional western music notation Many these systems seek improve upon traditional notation using chromatic staff which each the pitch classes has its own unique place the staff Examples are the AillerBrennink notation JacquesDaniel Rochats Dodeka music notation Tom Reeds Twinline notation Russell Ambroses Ambrose Piano Tabs Paul Morris Clairnote John Kellers Express Stave and Jos Sotorrios Bilinear Music Notation These notation systems not require the use standard key signatures accidentals clef signs They also represent interval relationships more consistently and accurately than traditional notation The Music Notation Project formerly known the Music Notation Modernization Association has website with information many these notation systems The term graphic notation refers the contemporary use nontraditional symbols and text convey
