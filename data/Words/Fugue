music fugue fju fewg contrapuntal compositional technique two more voices built subject musical theme that introduced the beginning imitation repetition different pitches and which recurs frequently the course the composition not confused with fuguing tune which style song popularized and mostly limited early American shape note Sacred Harp music and West Gallery music fugue usually has three main sections exposition development and final entry that contains the return the subject the fugues tonic key Some fugues have recapitulation the Middle Ages the term was widely used denote any works canonic style the Renaissance had come denote specifically imitative works Since the 17th century the term fugue has described what commonly regarded the most fully developed procedure imitative counterpoint Most fugues open with short main theme the subject which then sounds successively each voice after the first voice finished stating the subject second voice repeats the subject different pitch and other voices repeat the same way when each voice has entered the exposition complete This often followed connecting passage episode developed from previously heard material further entries the subject then are heard related keys Episodes applicable and entries are usually alternated until the final entry the subject which point the music has returned the opening key tonic which often followed closing material the coda this sense fugue style composition rather than fixed structure The form evolved during the 18th century from several earlier types contrapuntal compositions such imitative ricercars capriccios canzonas and fantasias The famous fugue composer Johann Sebastian Bach 16851750 shaped his own works after those Johann Jakob Froberger 16161667 Johann Pachelbel 16531706 Girolamo Frescobaldi 15831643 Dieterich Buxtehude 16371707 and others With the decline sophisticated styles the end the baroque period the fugues central role waned eventually giving way sonata form and the symphony orchestra rose dominant position Nevertheless composers continued write and study fugues for various purposes they appear the works Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 17561791 and Ludwig van Beethoven 17701827 well modern composers such Dmitri Shostakovich 19061975 The English term fugue originated the 16th century and derived from the French word fugue the Italian fuga This turn comes from Latin also fuga which itself related both fugere flee and fugare chase The adjectival form fugal Variants include fughetta literally small fugue and fugato passage fugal style within another work that not fugue fugue begins with the exposition and written according certain predefined rules later portions the composer has more freedom though logical key structure usually followed Further entries the subject will occur throughout the fugue repeating the accompanying material the same time The various entries may may not separated episodes What follows chart displaying fairly typical fugal outline and explanation the processes involved creating this structure fugue begins with the exposition its subject one the voices alone the tonic key After the statement the subject second voice enters and states the subject with the subject transposed another key usually the dominant subdominant which known the answer make the music run smoothly may also have altered slightly When the answer exact copy the subject the new key with identical intervals the first statement classified real answer the intervals are altered maintain the key tonal answer tonal answer usually called for when the subject begins with prominent dominant note where there prominent dominant note very close the beginning the subject prevent undermining the musics sense key this note transposed fourth the tonic rather than fifth the supertonic Answers the subdominant are also employed for the same reason While the answer being stated the voice which the subject was previously heard continues with new material this new material reused later statements the subject called countersubject this accompanying material only heard once simply referred free counterpoint The countersubject written invertible counterpoint the octave fifteenth The distinction made between the use free counterpoint and regular countersubjects accompanying the fugue subjectanswer because order for countersubject heard accompanying the subject more than one instance must capable sounding correctly above below the subject and must conceived therefore invertible double counterpoint tonal music invertible contrapuntal lines must written according certain rules because several intervallic combinations while acceptable one particular orientation are longer permissible when inverted For example when the note sounds one voice above the note lower voice the interval fifth formed which considered consonant and entirely acceptable When this interval inverted the upper voice above the lower forms fourth considered dissonance tonal contrapuntal practice and requires special treatment preparation and resolution used The countersubject sounding the same time the answer transposed the pitch the answer Each voice then responds with its own subject answer and further countersubjects free counterpoint may heard When tonal answer used customary for the exposition alternate subjects with answers however some fugues this order occasionally varied see the SAAS arrangement Fugue Major BWV 846 from Bachs WellTempered Clavier Book brief codetta often heard connecting the various statements the subject and answer This allows the music run smoothly The codetta just the other parts the exposition can used throughout the rest the fugue The first answer must occur soon after the initial statement the subject possible therefore the first codetta often extremely short not needed the above example this the case the subject finishes the quarter note crotchet the third beat the second bar which harmonizes the opening the answer The later codettas may considerably longer and often serve develop the material heard far the subjectanswer and countersubject and possibly introduce ideas heard the second countersubject free counterpoint that follows delay and therefore heighten the impact the reentry the subject another voice well modulating back the tonic The exposition usually concludes when all voices have given statement the subject answer some fugues the exposition will end with redundant entry extra presentation the theme Furthermore some fugues the entry one the voices may reserved until later for example the pedals organ fugue see Bachs Fugue major for Organ BWV 547 Further entries the subject follow this initial exposition either immediately for example Fugue major BWV 846 the WellTempered Clavier separated episodes Episodic material always modulatory and usually based upon some element heard the exposition Each episode has the primary function transitioning for the next entry the subject new key and may also provide release from the strictness form employed the exposition and middleentries Andr Gedalge states that the episode the fugue generally based series imitations the subject that have been fragmented Further entries the subject middle entries occur throughout the fugue They must state the subject answer least once its entirety and may also heard combination with the countersubjects from the exposition new countersubjects free counterpoint any these combination uncommon for the subject enter alone single voice the middleentries the exposition rather usually heard with least one the countersubjects andor other free contrapuntal accompaniments Middleentries tend occur pitches other than the initial shown the typical structure above these are often closelyrelated keys such the relative dominant and subdominant although the key structure fugues varies greatly the fugues Bach the first middleentry occurs most often the relative major minor the works overall key and followed entry the dominant the relative major minor when the fugues subject requires tonal answer the fugues earlier composers notably Buxtehude and Pachelbel middle entries keys other than the tonic and dominant tend the exception and nonmodulation the norm One the famous examples such nonmodulating fugue occurs Buxtehudes Praeludium Fugue and Chaconne BuxWV 137 When there entrance the subject and answer material the composer can develop the subject altering the subject This called episode often inversion although the term sometimes used synonymously with middleentry and may also describe the exposition completely new subjects double fugue for example see below any the entries within fugue the subject may altered inversion retrograde less common form where the entire subject heard backtofront and diminution the reduction the subjects rhythmic values certain factor augmentation the increase the subjects rhythmic values certain factor any combination them The excerpt below bars 712 Bachs Fugue minor BWV 847 from the WellTempered Clavier Book illustrates the application most the characteristics described above The fugue for keyboard and three voices with regular countersubjects This excerpt opens last entry the exposition the subject sounding the bass the first countersubject the treble while the middlevoice stating second version the second countersubject which concludes with the characteristic rhythm the subject and always used together with the first version the second countersubject Following this episode modulates from the tonic the relative major means sequence the form accompanied canon the fourth Arrival major marked quasi perfect cadence across the bar line from the last quarter note beat the first bar the first beat the second bar the second system and the first middle entry Here Bach has altered the second countersubject accommodate the change mode any point the fugue there may false entries the subject which include the start the subject but are not completed False entries are often abbreviated the head the subject and anticipate the true entry the subject heightening the impact the subject proper The counterexposition second exposition However there are only two entries and the entries occur reverse order The counterexposition fugue separated from the exposition episode and the same key the original exposition Sometimes counterexpositions the middle entries take place stretto whereby one voice responds with the subjectanswer before the first voice has completed its entry the subjectanswer usually increasing the intensity the music Only one entry the subject must heard its completion stretto However stretto which the subjectanswer heard completion all voices known stretto maestrale grand stretto Strettos may also occur inversion augmentation and diminution fugue which the opening exposition takes place stretto form known close fugue stretto fugue see for example the Gratias agimus tibi and Dona nobis pacem choruses from Bachs Mass Minor The closing section fugue often includes one two counterexpositions and possibly stretto the tonic sometimes over tonic dominant pedal note Any material that follows the final entry the subject considered the final coda and normally cadential simple fugue has only one subject and does not utilize invertible counterpoint double fugue has two subjects that are often developed simultaneously Similarly triple fugue has three subjects There are two kinds double fugue fugue which the second subject presented simultaneously with the subject the exposition Kyrie Eleison Mozarts Requiem minor and fugue which the second subject has its own exposition some later point and the two subjects are not combined until later see for example Fugue minor from Bachs WellTempered Clavier Book more famously Bachs Anne Fugue major BWV 552 triple fugue for organ counterfugue fugue which the first answer presented the subject inversion upside down and the inverted subject continues feature prominently throughout the fugue Examples include Contrapunctus through Contrapunctus VII from Bachs The Art Fugue Permutation fugue describes type composition technique composition which elements fugue and strict canon are combined Each voice enters succession with the subject each entry alternating between tonic and dominant and each voice having stated the initial subject continues stating two more themes countersubjects which must conceived correct invertible counterpoint other words the subject and countersubjects must capable being played both above and below all the other themes without creating any unacceptable dissonances Each voice takes this pattern and states all the subjectsthemes the same order and repeats the material when all the themes have been stated sometimes after rest There usually very little nonstructuralthematic material During the course permutation fugue quite uncommon actually for every single possible voicecombination permutation the themes heard This limitation exists consequence sheer proportionality the more voices fugue the greater the amount possible permutations consequence composers exercise editorial judgment the most musical permutations and processes leading thereto One example permutation fugue can seen the opening chorus Bachs cantata Himmelsknig sei willkommen BWV182 Permutation fugues differ from conventional fugue that there are connecting episodes nor statement the themes related keys for example the fugue Bachs Passacaglia and Fugue minor BWV 582 not purely permutation fugue does have episodes between permutation expositions Invertible counterpoint essential permutation fugues but not found simple fugues fughetta short fugue that has the same characteristics fugue Often the contrapuntal writing not strict and the setting less formal See for example variation Beethovens Diabelli Variations 120 The term fuga was used far back the Middle Ages but was initially used refer any kind imitative counterpoint including canons which are now thought distinct from fugues Prior the 16th century fugue was originally genre was not until the 16th century that fugal technique understood today began seen pieces both instrumental and vocal Fugal writing found works such fantasias ricercares and canzonas Fugue theoretical term first occurred 1330 when Jacobus Liege wrote about the fuga his Speculum musicae The fugue arose from the technique imitation where the same musical material was repeated starting different note Gioseffo Zarlino composer author and theorist the Renaissance was one the first distinguish between the two types imitative counterpoint fugues and canons which called imitations Originally this was aid improvisation but the 1550s was considered technique composition The Renaissance composer Giovanni Pierluigi Palestrina 15251594 wrote masses using modal counterpoint and imitation and fugal writing became the basis for writing motets well Palestrinas imitative motets differed from fugues that each phrase the text had different subject which was introduced and worked out separately whereas fugue continued working with the same subject subjects throughout the entire length the piece was the Baroque period that the writing fugues became central composition part demonstration compositional expertise Fugues were incorporated into variety musical forms Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck Girolamo Frescobaldi Johann Jakob Froberger and Dieterich Buxtehude all wrote fugues and George Frideric Handel included them many his oratorios Keyboard suites from this time often conclude with fugal gigue Domenico Scarlatti has only few fugues among his corpus over 500 harpsichord sonatas The French overture featured quick fugal section after slow introduction The second movement sonata chiesa written Arcangelo Corelli and others was usually fugal The Baroque period also saw rise the importance music theory Some fugues during the Baroque period were pieces designed teach contrapuntal technique students The most influential text was Johann Joseph Fuxs Gradus Parnassum Steps Parnassus which appeared 1725 This work laid out the terms species counterpoint and offered series exercises learn fugue writing Fuxs work was largely based the practice Palestrinas modal fugues Mozart studied from this book and remained influential into the nineteenth century Haydn for example taught counterpoint from his own summary Fux and thought the basis for formal structure Bachs most famous fugues are those for the harpsichord The WellTempered Clavier which many composers and theorists look the greatest model fugue The WellTempered Clavier comprises two volumes written different times Bachs life each comprising prelude and fugue pairs one for each major and minor key Bach also known for his organ fugues which are usually preceded prelude toccata The Art Fugue BWV 1080 collection fugues and four canons single theme that gradually transformed the cycle progresses Bach also wrote smaller single fugues and put fugal sections movements into many his more general works Bachs influence extended forward through his son CPE Bach and through the theorist Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg 17181795 whose Abhandlung von der Fuge Treatise the fugue 1753 was largely based Bachs work During the Classical era the fugue was longer central even fully natural mode musical composition Nevertheless both Haydn and Mozart had periods their careers which they some sense rediscovered fugal writing and used frequently their work Joseph Haydn was the leader fugal composition and technique the Classical era Haydns most famous fugues can found his Sun Quartets 1772 which three have fugal finales This was practice that Haydn repeated only once later his quartetwriting career with the finale his String Quartet 1787 Some the earliest examples Haydns use counterpoint however are three symphonies and that date from 176263 The earliest fugues both the symphonies and the Baryton trios exhibit the influence Joseph Fuxs treatise counterpoint Gradus Parnassum 1725 which Haydn studied carefully Haydns second fugal period occurred after heard and was greatly inspired the oratorios Handel during his visits London 17911793 17941795 Haydn then studied Handels techniques and incorporated Handelian fugal writing into the choruses his mature oratorios The Creation and The Seasons well several his later symphonies including and 101 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart studied counterpoint when young with Padre Martini Bologna However the major impetus fugal writing for Mozart was the influence Baron Gottfried van Swieten Vienna around 1782 Van Swieten during diplomatic service Berlin had taken the opportunity collect many manuscripts Bach and Handel could and invited Mozart study his collection and also encouraged him transcribe various works for other combinations instruments Mozart was evidently fascinated these works and wrote set transcriptions for string trio fugues from Bachs WellTempered Clavier introducing them with preludes his own letter his sister dated Vienna April 1782 Mozart recognizes that had not written anything this form but moved the interest Constance composed one piece which sent with the letter begs his sister not let anybody see the fugue and manifests the hope write five more and then present them Baron van Swieten Regarding the piece said have taken particular care write andante maestoso upon that should not played fast for fugue not played slowly the ear cannot clearly distinguish the new subject introduced and the effect missed Mozart then set writing fugues his own mimicking the Baroque style These included the fugues for String Quartet 405 1782 and Fugue Minor 426 for two pianos 1783 Later Mozart incorporated fugal writing into his opera Die Zauberflte and the finale his Symphony The parts the Requiem completed also contain several fugues most notably the Kyrie and the three fugues the Domine Jesu also left behind sketch for Amen fugue which some believewho would have come the end the Sequentia Ludwig van Beethoven was familiar with fugal writing from childhood important part his training was playing from The WellTempered Clavier During his early career Vienna Beethoven attracted notice for his performance these fugues There are fugal sections Beethovens early piano sonatas and fugal writing found the second and fourth movements the Eroica Symphony 1805 Beethoven incorporated fugues his sonatas and reshaped the episodes purpose and compositional technique for later generations composers Nevertheless fugues did not take truly central role Beethovens work until his late period The finale Beethovens Hammerklavier Sonata contains fugue which was practically unperformed until the late 19th century due its tremendous technical difficulty and length The last movement his Cello Sonata 102 fugue and there are fugal passages the last movements his Piano Sonatas major 101 and major 110 According Charles Rosen 1971 p503 With the finale 110 Beethoven reconceived the significance the most traditional elements fugue writing Fugal passages are also found the Missa Solemnis and all movements the Ninth Symphony except the third massive dissonant fugue forms the finale his String Quartet 130 1825 the latter was later published separately 133 the Groe Fuge Great Fugue However the fugue that opens Beethovens String Quartet minor 131 that several commentators regard one the composers greatest achievements Joseph Kerman 1966 p330 calls this most moving all fugues JWN Sullivan 1927 p235 hears the most superhuman piece music that Beethoven has ever written Philip Radcliffe 1965 p149 says bare description its formal outline can give but little idea the extraordinary profundity this fugue the beginning the Romantic era fugue writing had become specifically attached the norms and styles the Baroque Felix Mendelssohn wrote many fugues inspired his study the music Bach Franz Liszts Piano Sonata minor 1853 contains powerful fugue demanding incisive virtuosity from its player Giuseppe Verdi included whimsical example the end his opera Falstaff and his setting the Requiem Mass contained two originally three choral fuguescitation needed Anton Bruckner and Gustav Mahler also included them their respective symphonies The exposition the finale Bruckners Fifth Symphony begins with fugal exposition The exposition ends with chorale the melody which then used second fugal exposition the beginning the development The recapitulation features both fugal subjects concurrentlycitation needed The finale Mahlers Symphony features fuguelike passage early the movement though this not actually example fugue Twentiethcentury composers brought fugue back its position prominence realizing its uses full instrumental works its importance development and introductory sections and the developmental capabilities fugal composition The second movement Maurice Ravels piano suite Tombeau Couperin 1917 fugue that Roy Howat 200 p88 describes having subtle glint jazz Bla Bartks Music for Strings Percussion and Celesta 1936 opens with slow fugue that Pierre Boulez 1986 pp34647 regards certainly the finest and most characteristic example Bartks subtle style probably the most timeless all Bartks works fugue that unfolds like fan point maximum intensity and then closes returning the mysterious atmosphere the opening Igor Stravinsky also incorporated fugues into his works including the Symphony Psalms and the Dumbarton Oaks concerto Stravinsky recognized the compositional techniques Bach and the second movement his Symphony Psalms 1930 lays out fugue that much like that the Baroque era employs double fugue with two distinct subjects the first beginning and the second Techniques such stretto sequencing and the use subject incipits are frequently heard the movement Olivier Messiaen writing about his Vingt regards sur lenfantJsus 1944 wrote the sixth piece that collection Par Lui tout fait Him were all things made expresses the Creation All Things space time stars planets and the Countenance rather the Thought God behind the flames and the seething impossible even speak have not attempted describe Instead have sheltered behind the form the Fugue Bachs Art Fugue and the fugue from Beethovens Opus 106 the

and Dolls written Frank Loesser the characters NicelyNicely Benny and Rusty sing simultaneously about hot tips they each have upcoming horse race few examples also exist within progressive rock such the central movement The Endless Enigma Emerson Lake Palmer and Reflection Gentle Giant widespread view the fugue that not musical form but rather technique composition The Austrian musicologist Erwin Ratz argues that the formal organization fugue involves not only the arrangement its theme and episodes but also its harmonic structure particular the exposition and coda tend emphasize the tonic key whereas the episodes usually explore more distant tonalities Ratz stressed however that this the core underlying form Urform the fugue from which individual fugues may deviate Thus noted that while certain related keys are more commonly explored fugal development the overall structure fugue does not limit its harmonic structure For example fugue may not even explore the dominant one the most closely related keys the tonic Bachs Fugue major from book one the Well Tempered Clavier explores the relative minor the supertonic and the subdominant This unlike later forms such the sonata which clearly prescribes which keys are explored typically the tonic and dominant ABA form Then many modern fugues dispense with traditional tonal harmonic scaffolding altogether and either use serial pitchoriented rules the KyrieChriste Gyrgy Ligetis Requiem Witold Lutosawski works use panchromatic even denser harmonic spectra Fugue the most complex contrapuntal forms Ratzs words fugal technique significantly burdens the shaping musical ideas and was given only the greatest geniuses such Bach and Beethoven breathe life into such unwieldy form and make the bearer the highest thoughts presenting Bachs fugues among the greatest contrapuntal works Peter Kivy points out that counterpoint itself since time out mind has been associated the thinking musicians with the profound and the serious and argues that there seems some rational justification for their doing This related the idea that restrictions create freedom for the composer directing their efforts also points out that fugal writing has its roots improvisation and was during the Renaissance practiced improvisatory art Writing 1555 Nicola Vicentino for example suggests that the composer having completed the initial imitative entrances take the passage which has served accompaniment the theme and make the basis for new imitative treatment that will always have material with which compose without having stop and reflect This formulation the basic rule for fugal improvisation anticipates later sixteenthcentury discussions which deal with the improvisational technique the keyboard more extensively
