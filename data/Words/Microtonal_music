musiceg the Delphic Hymns The ancient Greeks approached the creation different musical intervals and modes dividing and combining tetrachords recognizing three genera tetrachords the enharmonic the chromatic and the diatonic Ancient Greek intervals were many different sizes including microtones The enharmonic genus particular featured intervals distinctly microtonal nature which were sometimes smaller than cents less than half the contemporary Western semitone 100 cents the ancient Greek enharmonic genus the tetrachord contained semitone varying sizes approximately 100 cents divided into two equal intervals called dieses single diesis conjunction with larger interval roughly 400 cents these intervals comprised the perfect fourth approximately 498 cents the ratio just intonation West
