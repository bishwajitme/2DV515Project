Multimonitor also called multidisplay and multihead the use multiple physical display devices such monitors televisions and projectors order increase the area available for computer programs running single computer system Research studies show that depending the type work multihead may increase the productivity 5070 Multiple computers can connected provide single display over Gigabit EthernetEthernet drive large video wall One way extend the number displays one computer add displays via USB Starting 2006 DisplayLink released several chips for USB support VGADVILVDS and other interfaces many professions including graphic design architecture communications accounting engineering and video editing the idea two more monitors being driven from one machine not new one While the past has meant multiple graphics adapters and specialized software was common for engineers have least two not more displays enhance productivity Multimonitor gamingsimulation also becoming more common however the hardware expense can limiting factor The rising popularity using multiple monitors game leading websites being introduced which allow for smooth and easy configuration from outside sources from the original one screen option given developers new multiple screen option Early versions DOOM permitted threemonitor display mode using three networked machines show left right and center views More recently games have used multiple monitors show more absorbing interface the player display game information Various flight simulators can use these monitor setups create artificial cockpit with more realistic interfaces Others such Supreme Commander and World Conflict can use additional monitor for large scale map the battlefield large number older games support multimonitor setups treating the total screen space effectively single monitor the game technique known spanning Many games without inherent multimonitor support such Guild Wars and World Warcraft can also made run multimonitor setups with this technique conjunction with addition thirdparty software larger list games that support dualmultiscreen modes available WSGF arcade technology entered the 1990s larger cabinets were being built which turn also housed larger monitors such the screen version Namcos Ridge Racer from 1993 Although large screen technology such CRT rear projection was beginning used more often multimonitor games were still occasionally released such Segas F355 Challenge from 1999 which again used monitors for the sitdown cockpit version The most recent use multimonitor setup arcades occurred with Taitos Dariusburst Another Chronicle game released Japan December 2010 and worldwide the following year uses LCD screens and angled mirror create seamless widescreen effect Ordinary software does not need special support for multiple screens even uses the graphic accelerator the usual application level multihead presented just single larger monitor spanning over all screens However some special approaches may increase the multithread performance With multiple monitors present each screen will have its own graphics buffer One possible scenario for programming present OpenGL DirectX continuous virtual frame buffer which the graphics driver writes out each individual buffer With some graphics cards its possible enable mode called horizontal span which accomplishes this The OpenGLDirectX programmer then renders very large frame buffer for output practice and with recent cards this mode being phased out because does not make very good use GPU parallelism and does not support arbitrary arrangements monitors they must all horizontal more recent technique uses the wglShareLists feature OpenGL share data across multiple GPUs and then render each individual monitors frame buffer Android supports additional monitor version but additional software needed multitaskuse both once
