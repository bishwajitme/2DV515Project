The prehistory Egypt spans the period from the earliest human settlement the beginning the Early Dynastic Period Egypt around 3100 starting with the first Pharaoh Narmer for some Egyptologists HorAha for others with the name Menes also possibly used for one these kings This Predynastic era traditionally equivalent the final part the Neolithic period beginning 6000 and corresponds the Naqada III period The dates the Predynastic period were first defined before widespread archaeological excavation Egypt took place and recent finds indicating very gradual Predynastic development have led controversy over when exactly the Predynastic period ended Thus various terms such Protodynastic period Zero Dynasty Dynasty are used name the part the period which might characterized Predynastic some and Early Dynastic others The Predynastic period generally divided into cultural eras each named after the place where certain type Egyptian settlement was first discovered However the same gradual development that characterizes the Protodynastic period present throughout the entire Predynastic period and individual cultures must not interpreted separate entities but largely subjective divisions used facilitate study the entire period The vast majority Predynastic archaeological finds have been Upper Egypt because the silt the Nile River was more heavily deposited the Delta region completely burying most Delta sites long before modern times The Late Paleolithic Egypt started around 30000 The Nazlet Khater skeleton was found 1980 and dated 1982 from nine samples ranging between 35100 and 30360 years This specimen the only complete modern human skeleton from the earliest Late Stone Age Africa Excavation the Nile has exposed early stone tools The earliest these lithic industries were located within the 30metre 100ft terrace and were Chellean primitive Acheulean and Egyptian form the Clactonian Within the 15metre 50ft terrace was developed Acheulean Originally reported Early Mousterian but since changed Levalloisean other implements were located the 10metre 30ft terrace The and 3metre 1510ft terraces saw more developed version the Levalloisean also initially reported Egyptian version Mousterian Finally tools the Egyptian Sebilian technology and Egyptian version the Aterian technology were also located Some the oldest known buildings were discovered Egypt archaeologist Waldemar Chmielewski along the southern border near Wadi Halfa Sudan Arkin site Chimelewski dated the structures 100000 The remains the structures are oval depressions about deep and meters across Many are lined with flat sandstone slabs They are called tent rings because the rocks support domelike shelter skins brush This type dwelling provides permanent place live but necessary can taken down easily and moved They were mobile structureseasily disassembled moved and reassembledproviding huntergatherers with semipermanent habitation Aterian toolmaking reached Egypt 40000 The Khormusan industry Egypt began between 42000 and 32000 Khormusans developed tools not only from stone but also from animal bones and hematite They also developed small arrow heads resembling those Native Americans but bows have been found The end the Khormusan industry came around 16000 with the appearance other cultures the region including the Gemaian The Halfan and Kubbaniyan two closely related industries flourished along the Upper Nile Valley Halfan sites are found the far north Sudan whereas Kubbaniyan sites are found Upper Egypt For the Halfan only four radiocarbon dates have been produced Schild and Wendorf 2014 discard the earliest and latest erratic and conclude that the Halfan existed 225220 cal People survived diet large herd animals and the Khormusan tradition fishing Greater concentrations artifacts indicate that they were not bound seasonal wandering but settled for longer periodscitation needed The Halfan culture was derived turn from the Khormusan which depended specialized hunting fishing and collecting techniques for survival The primary material remains this culture are stone tools flakes and multitude rock paintings Egypt analyses pollen found archaeological sites indicate that the Sebilian culture also known the Esna culture were gathering wheat and barley The Sebilian culture began around 13000 and vanished around 10000 BCcitation needed Domesticated seeds were not found modern wheat and barley originated Asia Minor and Canaan has been hypothesized that the sedentary lifestyle used farmers led increased warfare which was detrimental farming and brought this period end The Qadan culture 130009000 was Mesolithic industry that archaeological evidence suggests originated Upper Egypt present day south Egypt approximately 15000 years ago The Qadan subsistence mode estimated have persisted for approximately 4000 years was characterized hunting well unique approach food gathering that incorporated the preparation and consumption wild grasses and grains Systematic efforts were made the Qadan people water care for and harvest local plant life but grains were not planted ordered rows Around twenty archaeological sites Upper Nubia give evidence for the existence the Qadan cultures graingrinding culture Its makers also practiced wild grain harvesting along the Nile during the beginning the Sahaba Daru Nile phase when desiccation the Sahara caused residents the Libyan oases retreat into the Nile valley Among the Qadan culture sites the Jebel Sahaba cemetery which has been dated the Mesolithic Qadan peoples were the first develop sickles and they also developed grinding stones independently aid the collecting and processing these plant foods prior consumption However there are indications the use these tools after around 10000 when huntergatherers replaced them The Harifians are viewed migrating out the Fayyum and the eastern deserts Egypt during the late Mesolithic merge with the PrePottery Neolithic PPNB culture whose tool assemblage resembles that the Harifian This assimilation led the CircumArabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex group cultures that invented nomadic pastoralism and may have been the original culture which spread ProtoSemitic languages throughout Mesopotamia Continued expansion the desert forced the early ancestors the Egyptians settle around the Nile more permanently and adopt more sedentary lifestyle The period from 9000 6000 has left very little the way archaeological evidence Around 6000 Neolithic settlements appear all over Egypt Studies based morphological genetic and archaeological data have attributed these settlements migrants from the Fertile Crescent the Near East returning during the Egyptian and North African Neolithic bringing agriculture the region However other regions Africa independently developed agriculture about the same time the Ethiopian highlands the Sahel and West Africa Some morphological and postcranial data has linked the earliest farming populations Fayum Merimde and ElBadari Near Eastern populations However the archaeological data also suggests that Near Eastern domesticates were incorporated into preexisting foraging strategy and only slowly developed into fullblown lifestyle contrary what would expected from settler colonists from the Near East Finally the names for the Near Eastern domesticates imported into Egypt were not Sumerian ProtoSemitic loan words which further diminishes the likelihood mass immigrant colonization lower Egypt during the transition agriculture Weaving evidenced for the first time during the Faiyum Period People this period unlike later Egyptians buried their dead very close and sometimes inside their settlements Although archaeological sites reveal very little about this time examination the many Egyptian words for city provide hypothetical list reasons why the Egyptians settled Upper Egypt terminology indicates trade protection livestock high ground for flood refuge and sacred sites for deities From about 5000 4200 the Merimde culture far only known from big settlement site the edge the Western Delta flourished Lower Egypt The culture has strong connections the Faiyum culture well the Levant People lived small huts produced simple undecorated pottery and had stone tools Cattle sheep goats and pigs were held Wheat sorghum and barley were planted The Merimde people buried their dead within the settlement and produced clay figurines The first Egyptian lifesize head made clay comes from Merimde The Omari culture known from small settlement near modern Cairo People seem have lived huts but only postholes and pits survive The pottery undecorated Stone tools include small flakes axes and sickles Metal was not yet known Their sites were occupied from 4000BC the Archaic Period The Maadi culture also called Buto Maadi culture the most important Lower Egyptian prehistoric culture contemporary with Naqada and phases Upper Egypt The culture best known from the site Maadi near Cairo but also attested many other places the Delta the Fayum region This culture was marked development architecture and technology also followed its predecessor cultures when comes undecorated ceramics Copper was known and some copper adzes have been found The pottery simple and undecorated and shows some forms strong connections the southern Levantcitation needed People lived small huts partly dug into the ground The dead were buried cemeteries but with few burial goods The Maadi culture was replaced the Naqada III culture whether this happened conquest infiltration still open question The Tasian culture was the next Upper Egypt This culture group named for the burials found Der Tasa the east bank the Nile between Asyut and Akhmim The Tasian culture group notable for producing the earliest blacktopware type red and brown pottery that painted black the top and interior This pottery vital the dating Predynastic Egypt Because all dates for the Predynastic period are tenuous best WMF Petrie developed system called Sequence Dating which the relative date not the absolute date any given Predynastic site can ascertained examining its pottery the Predynastic period progressed the handles pottery evolved from functional ornamental The degree which any given archaeological site has functional ornamental pottery can also used determine the relative date the site Since there little difference between Tasian ceramics and Badarian pottery the Tasian Culture overlaps the Badarian range significantly From the Tasian period onward appears that Upper Egypt was influenced strongly the culture Lower Egypt The Badarian culture from about 4400 4000BC named for the Badari site near Der Tasa followed the Tasian culture but was similar that many consider them one continuous period The Badarian Culture continued produce the kind pottery called blacktopware albeit much improved quality and was assigned Sequence Dating numbers 2129 The primary difference that prevents scholars from merging the two periods that Badarian sites use copper addition stone and are thus chalcolithic settlements while the Neolithic Tasian sites are still considered Stone Age Badarian flint tools continued develop into sharper and more shapely blades and the first faience was developed Distinctly Badarian sites have been located from Nekhen little north Abydos appears that the Fayum culture and the Badarian and Tasian Periods overlapped significantly however the Fayum culture was considerably less agricultural and was still Neolithic nature The Amratian culture lasted from about 4000 3500BC named after the site ElAmra about 120km south Badari ElAmra the first site where this culture group was found unmingled with the later Gerzean culture group but this period better attested the Naqada site also referred the Naqada culture Blacktopped ware continues appear but white crossline ware type pottery which has been decorated with close parallel white lines being crossed another set close parallel white lines also found this time The Amratian period falls between and Petries Sequence Dating system Newly excavated objects attest increased trade between Upper and Lower Egypt this time stone vase from the north was found elAmra and copper which not mined Egypt was imported from the Sinai possibly Nubia Obsidian and small amount gold were both definitely imported from Nubia Trade with the oases also was likely New innovations appeared Amratian settlements precursors later cultural periods For example the mudbrick buildings for which the Gerzean period known were first seen Amratian times but only small numbers Additionally oval and theriomorphic cosmetic palettes appear this period but the workmanship very rudimentary and the relief artwork for which they were later known not yet present The Gerzean culture from about 3500 3200BC named after the site Gerzeh was the next stage Egyptian cultural development and was during this time that the foundation Dynastic Egypt was laid Gerzean culture largely unbroken development out Amratian Culture starting the delta and moving south through upper Egypt but failing dislodge Amratian culture Nubia Gerzean pottery assigned values from through and distinctly different from Amratian white crosslined wares blacktopped ware Gerzean pottery was painted mostly dark red with pictures animals people and ships well geometric symbols that appear derived from animals Also wavy handles rare before this period though occasionally found early became more common and more elaborate until they were almost completely ornamental Gerzean culture coincided with significant decline rainfall and farming along the Nile now produced the vast majority food though contemporary paintings indicate that hunting was not entirely forgone With increased food supplies Egyptians adopted much more sedentary lifestyle and cities grew large 5000 was this time that Egyptian city dwellers stopped building with reeds and began massproducing mud bricks first found the Amratian Period build their cities Egyptian stone tools while still use moved from bifacial construction rippleflaked construction Copper was used for all kinds tools and the first copper weaponry appears here Silver gold lapis and faience were used ornamentally and the grinding palettes used for eyepaint since the Badarian period began adorned with relief carvings The first tombs classic Egyptian style were also built modeled after ordinary houses and sometimes composed multiple rooms Although further excavations the Delta are needed this style generally believed originate there and not Upper Egypt Although the Gerzean Culture now clearly identified being the continuation the Amratian period significant amounts Mesopotamian influences worked their way into Egypt during the Gerzean which were interpreted previous years evidence Mesopotamian ruling class the socalled Dynastic Race coming power over Upper Egypt This idea longer attracts academic support Distinctly foreign objects and art forms entered Egypt during this period indicating contacts with several parts Asia Objects such the Gebel elArak knife handle which has patently Mesopotamian relief carvings have been found Egypt and the silver which appears this period can only have been obtained from Asia Minor addition Egyptian objects are created which clearly mimic Mesopotamian forms although not slavishly Cylinder seals appear Egypt well recessed paneling architecture the Egyptian reliefs cosmetic palettes are clearly made the same style the contemporary Mesopotamian Uruk culture and the ceremonial mace heads which turn from the late Gerzean and early Semainean are crafted the Mesopotamian pearshaped style instead the Egyptian native style The route this trade difficult determine but contact with Canaan does not predate the early dynastic usually assumed have been water During the time when the Dynastic Race Theory was still popular was theorized that Uruk sailors circumnavigated Arabia but Mediterranean route probably middlemen through Byblos more likely evidenced the presence Byblian objects Egypt The fact that many Gerzean sites are the mouths wadis which lead the Red Sea may indicate some amount trade via the Red Sea though Byblian trade potentially could have crossed the Sinai and then taken the Red Sea Also considered unlikely that something complicated recessed panel architecture could have worked its way into Egypt proxy and least small contingent migrants often suspected Despite this evidence foreign influence Egyptologists generally agree that the Gerzean Culture still predominantly indigenous Egypt The Naqada III period from about 3200 3000BC generally taken identical with the Protodynastic period during which Egypt was unified Naqada III notable for being the first era with hieroglyphs though this disputed some the first regular use serekhs the first irrigation and the first appearance royal cemeteries The relatively affluent Maadi suburb Cairo built over the original Naqada stronghold
