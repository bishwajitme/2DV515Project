Evolutionary linguistics subfield psycholinguistics that studies the psychosocial and cultural factors involved the origin language and the development linguistic universals The main challenge this research the lack empirical data spoken language leaves practically traces This led the abandonment the field for more than century despite the common origins language hinted the relationships among individual languages established the field historical linguistics Since the late 1980s the field has been revived the wake progresscitation needed made the related fields biolinguistics psycholinguistics neurolinguistics evolutionary anthropology evolutionary psychology universal grammar and cognitive science Inspired the natural sciences especially biology August Schleicher 18211868 became the first compare changing languages evolving species introduced the representation language families evolutionary tree Stammbaumtheorie articles published 1853 Stammbaumtheorie proved very productive for comparative linguistics but did not solve the major problem studying the origin language the lack fossil records Some scholars abandoned the question the origin language unsolvable Famously the Socit Linguistique Paris 1866 refused admit any further papers the subjectJoseph Jastrow published gestural theory the evolution language the seventh volume Science 1886 The field reappeared 1988 the Linguistic Bibliography subfield psycholinguistics 1990 Steven Pinker and Paul Bloom published their paper Natural Language and Natural Selection which strongly argued for adaptationist approach language origins Development strengthened further with the establishment 1996 series conferences the Evolution Language subsequently known Evolang promoting scientific multidisciplinary approach the issue and interest from major academic publishers the Studies the Evolution Language series has appeared with Oxford University Press since 2001 and from scientific journals Evolutionary linguistics field rapidly emerging result developments neighboring disciplines what extent languages features are determined genes hotly debated dichotomy linguistics has had new light shed upon the discovery the FOXP2 gene English family with severe heritable language dysfunction was found have defective copy this gene Mutations the corresponding gene mice FOXP2 fairly well conserved modern humans share the same allele Neanderthals cause reductions size and vocalization rate both copies are damaged the Purkinje layer part the cerebellum that contains betterconnected neurons than any other develops abnormally runting more common and pups die within weeks due inadequate lung development Additionally higher presence FOXP2 songbirds correlated song changes with downregulation causing incomplete and inaccurate song imitation zebra finches general evidence suggests that the protein vital neuroplasticity There little support however for the idea that FOXP2 the grammar gene that had much with the relatively recent emergence syntactical speech Another controversial dichotomy the question whether human language solely human continuum with admittedly far removed animal communication systems Studies ethology have forced researchers reassess many claims uniquely human abilities for language and speech For instance Tecumseh Fitch has argued that the descended larynx not unique humans Similarly once held uniquely human traits such formant perception combinatorial phonology and compositional semantics are now thought shared with least some nonhuman animal species Conversely Derek Bickerton and others argue that the advent abstract words provided mental basis for analyzing higherorder relations and that any communication system that remotely resembles human language utterly relies cognitive architecture that coevolved alongside language leaves fossils languages form and even its presence are extremely hard impossible deduce from physical evidence Computational modeling now widely accepted approach assure the internal consistency languageevolution scenarios Approximately onethird all papers presented the 2010 Evolution Language conference rely least part computer simulations One original researcher the field Luc Steels head the research units Sony CSL Paris and the Lab the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and his team are currently investigating ways which artificial agents selforganize languages with naturallike properties and how meaning can coevolve with language Their research based the hypothesis that language complex adaptive system that emerges through adaptive interactions between agents and continues evolve order remain adapted the needs and capabilities the agents This research has been implemented fluid construction grammar FCG formalism for construction grammars that has been specially designed for the origins and evolution language The approach computational modeling and the use robotic agents grounded real life claimed theory independent enables the researcher find out exactly what cognitive capacities are needed for certain language phenomena emerge also focuses the researcher formulating hypotheses precise and exact manner whereas theoretical models often stay very vague Some linguists such John McWhorter have analyzed the evolution and construction basic communication methods such pidginization and creolization Nativist models universal grammar are informed linguistic universals such the existence pronouns and demonstratives and the similarities each languages process nominalization the process verbs becoming nouns well the reverse the process turning nouns into verbs This purely descriptive approach what mean natural language without attempting address its emergence Finally there are those archaeologists and evolutionary anthropologistsamong them Ian Watts Camilla Power and Chris Knight cofounder with James Hurford the EVOLANG series conferenceswho
