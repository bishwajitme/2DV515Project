computing Digital Object Identifier DOI persistent identifier handle used uniquely identify objects standardized the International Organization for Standardization ISO implementation the Handle System DOIs are wide use mainly identify academic professional and government information such journal articles research reports and data sets and official publications though they also have been used identify other types information resources such commercial videos DOI aims resolvable usually some form access the information object which the DOI refers This achieved binding the DOI metadata about the object such URL indicating where the object can found Thus being actionable and interoperable DOI differs from identifiers such ISBNs and ISRCs which aim only uniquely identify their referents The DOI system uses the indecs Content Model for representing metadata The DOI for document remains fixed over the lifetime the document whereas its location and other metadata may change Referring online document its DOI supposed provide more stable link than simply using its URL But every time URL changes the publisher has update the metadata for the DOI link the new URL the publishers responsibility update the DOI database they fail the DOI resolves dead link leaving the DOI useless The developer and administrator the DOI system the International DOI Foundation IDF which introduced 2000 Organizations that meet the contractual obligations the DOI system and are willing pay become member the system can assign DOIs The DOI system implemented through federation registration agencies coordinated the IDF late April 2011 more than million DOI names had been assigned some 4000 organizations and April 2013 this number had grown million DOI names assigned through 9500 organizations DOI type Handle System handle which takes the form character string divided into two parts prefix and suffix separated slash The prefix identifies the registrant the identifier and the suffix chosen the registrant and identifies the specific object associated with that DOI Most legal Unicode characters are allowed these strings which are interpreted caseinsensitive manner The prefix usually takes the form 10NNNN where NNNN series least numbers greater than equal 1000 whose limit depends only the total number registrants The prefix may further subdivided with periods like 10NNNNN For example the DOI name 101000182 the prefix 101000 and the suffix 182 The part the prefix distinguishes the handle part the DOI namespace opposed some other Handle System namespace and the characters 1000 the prefix identify the registrant this case the registrant the International DOI Foundation itself 182 the suffix item identifying single object this case the latest version the DOI Handbook DOI names can identify creative works such texts images audio video items and software both electronic and physical forms performances and abstract works such licenses parties transaction etc The names can refer objects varying levels detail thus DOI names can identify journal individual issue journal individual article the journal single table that article The choice level detail left the assigner but the DOI system must declared part the metadata that associated with DOI name using data dictionary based the indecs Content Model The official DOI Handbook explicitly states that DOIs should display screens and print the format doi101000182 Contrary the DOI Handbook CrossRef major DOI registration agency recommends displaying URL for example httpsdoiorg101000182 instead the officially specified format for example doi101000182 This URL persistent there contract that ensures persistence the DOIORG domain PURL providing the location HTTP proxy server which will redirect web accesses the correct online location the linked item The CrossRef recommendation primarily based the assumption that the DOI being displayed without being hyperlinked its appropriate URL the argument being that without the hyperlink not easy copyandpaste the full URL actually bring the page for the DOI thus the entire URL should displayed allowing people viewing the page containing the DOI copyandpaste the URL hand into new windowtab their browser order the appropriate page for the document the DOI represents Major applications the DOI system currently include the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Developments publication service OECD iLibrary each table graph OECD publication shown with DOI name that leads Excel file data underlying the tables and graphs Further development such services planned Other registries include Crossref and the multilingual European DOI Registration Agency Since 2015 RFCs can referenced doi1017487rfc DOI and other special identifiers can help unify information about references with different spelling various language versions Wikipedia The IDF designed the DOI system provide form persistent identification which each DOI name permanently and unambiguously identifies the object which associated also associates metadata with objects allowing provide users with relevant pieces information about the objects and their relationships Included part this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names resolved web locations where the objects they describe can found achieve its goals the DOI system combines the Handle System and the indecs Content Model with social infrastructure The Handle System ensures that the DOI name for object not based any changeable attributes the object such its physical location ownership that the attributes the object are encoded its metadata rather than its DOI name and that two objects are assigned the same DOI name Because DOI names are short character strings they are humanreadable may copied and pasted text and fit into the URI specification The DOI nameresolution mechanism acts behind the scenes that users communicate with the same way with any other web service built open architectures incorporates trust mechanisms and engineered operate reliably and flexibly that can adapted changing demands and new applications the DOI system DOI nameresolution may used with OpenURL select the most appropriate among multiple locations for given object according the location the user making the request However despite this ability the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users nonfree copies documents that would have been available for additional fee from alternative locations The indecs Content Model used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects small kernel common metadata shared all DOI names and can optionally extended with other relevant data which may public restricted Registrants may update the metadata for their DOI names any time such when publication information changes when object moves different URL The International DOI Foundation IDF oversees the integration these technologies and operation the system through technical and social infrastructure The social infrastructure federation independent registration agencies offering DOI services was modelled existing successful federated deployments identifiers such GS1 and ISBN DOI name differs from commonly used Internet pointers material such the Uniform Resource Locator URL that identifies object itself firstclass entity rather than the specific place where the object located certain time implements the Uniform Resource Identifier Uniform Resource Name concept and adds data model and social infrastructure DOI name also differs from standard identifier registries such the ISBN ISRC etc The purpose identifier registry manage given collection identifiers whereas the primary purpose the DOI system make collection identifiers actionable and interoperable where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections The DOI system offers persistent semanticallyinteroperable resolution related current data and best suited material that will used services outside the direct control the issuing assigner public citation managing content value uses managed registry providing social and technical infrastructure does not assume any specific business model for the provision identifiers services and enables other existing services link defined ways Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed The comparison persistent identifier approaches difficult because they are not all doing the same thing Imprecisely referring set schemes identifiers doesnt mean that they can compared easily Other identifier systems may enabling technologies with low barriers entry providing easy use labeling mechanism that allows anyone set new instance examples include Persistent Uniform Resource Locator PURL URLs Globally Unique Identifiers GUIDs etc but may lack some the functionality registrycontrolled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata controlled scheme The DOI system does not have this approach and should not compared directly such identifier schemes Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some the features offered the DOI system for specific sectors ARK DOI name does not depend the objects location and this way similar Uniform Resource Name URN PURL but differs from ordinary URL URLs are often used substitute identifiers for documents the Internet although the same document two different locations has two URLs contrast persistent identifiers such DOI names identify objects first class entities two instances the same object would have the same DOI name DOI name resolution provided through the Handle System developed Corporation for National Research Initiatives and freely available any user encountering DOI name Resolution redirects the user from DOI name one more pieces typed data URLs representing instances the object services such email one more items metadata the Handle System DOI name handle and has set values assigned and may thought record that consists group fields Each handle value must have data type specified its type field which defines the syntax and semantics its data While DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object which assigned DOI resolution may not persistent due technical and administrative issues resolve DOI name may input DOI resolver such doiorg Another approach which avoids typing cuttingandpasting into resolver include the DOI document URL which uses the resolver HTTP proxy such httpsdoiorg preferred httpdxdoiorg both which support HTTPS For example the DOI 101000182 can included reference hyperlink httpsdoiorg101000182 This approach allows users click the DOI normal hyperlink Indeed previously mentioned this how CrossRef recommends that DOIs always represented preferring HTTPS over HTTP that they are cutandpasted into other documents emails etc they will actionable Other DOI resolvers and HTTP Proxies include httphdlhandlenet and httpsdoipangaeade the beginning the year 2016 new class alternative DOI resolvers was started httpdoaiio This service unusual that tries find nonpaywalled version title and redirects you that instead the publishers version Since then other openaccess favoring DOI resolvers have been created notably httpsoadoiorg October 2016 While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely the Handle System alternative DOI resolvers first consult open access resources such BASE Bielefeld Academic Search Engine alternative HTTP proxies use one number addons and plugins for browsers thereby avoiding the conversion the DOIs URLs which depend domain names and may subject change while still allowing the DOI treated normal hyperlink For example the CNRI Handle Extension for Firefoxpermanent dead link enables the browser access Handle System handles DOIs like hdl42635374000 doi1010001 directly the Firefox browser using the native Handle System protocol This plugin can also replace references webtohandle proxy servers with native resolution disadvantage this approach for publishers that least present most users will encountering the DOIs browser mail reader other software which does not have one these plugins installed The International DOI Foundation IDF nonprofit organisation created 1998 the governance body the DOI system safeguards all intellectual property rights relating the DOI system manages common operational features and supports the development and promotion the DOI system The IDF ensures that any improvements made the DOI system including creation maintenance registration resolution and policymaking DOI names are available any DOI registrant also prevents third parties from imposing additional licensing requirements beyond those the IDF users the DOI system The IDF controlled Board elected the members the Foundation with appointed Managing Agent who responsible for coordinating and planning its activities Membership open all organizations with interest electronic publishing and related enabling technologies The IDF holds annual open meetings the topics DOI and related issues Registration agencies appointed the IDF provide services DOI registrants they allocate DOI prefixes register DOI names and provide the necessary infrastructure allow registrants declare and maintain metadata and state data Registration agencies are also expected actively promote the widespread adoption the DOI system cooperate with the IDF the development the DOI system whole and provide services behalf their specific user community list current RAs maintained the International DOI Foundation The IDF recognized one the federated registrars for the Handle System the DONA Foundation which the IDF board member and responsible for assigning Handle System prefixes under the toplevel prefix Registration agencies generally charge fee assign new DOI name parts these fees are used support the IDF The DOI system overall through the IDF operates notforprofit cost recovery basis The DOI system international standard developed the International Organization for Standardization its technical committee identification and description TC46SC9 The
