music harmony considers the process which the composition individual sounds superpositions sounds analysed hearing Usually this means simultaneously occurring frequencies pitches tones notes chords The study harmony involves chords and their construction and chord progressions and the principles connection that govern them Harmony often said refer the vertical aspect music distinguished from melodic line the horizontal aspect Counterpoint which refers the relationship between melodic lines and polyphony which refers the simultaneous sounding separate independent voices are thus sometimes distinguished from harmony popular and jazz harmony chords are named their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities many types music notably baroque romantic modern and jazz chords are often augmented with tensions tension additional chord member that creates relatively dissonant interval relation the bass Typically the classical common practice period dissonant chord chord with tension resolves consonant chord Harmonization usually sounds pleasant the ear when there balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds simple words that occurs when there balance between tense and relaxed moments The term harmony derives from the Greek harmonia meaning joint agreement concord from the verb harmoz fit together join the past harmony often referred the whole field music while music referred the arts generalcitation needed Ancient Greece the term defined the combination contrasted elements higher and lower note Nevertheless unclear whether the simultaneous sounding notes was part ancient Greek musical practice harmona may have merely provided system classification the relationships between different pitchescitation needed the Middle Ages the term was used describe two pitches sounding combination and the Renaissance the concept was expanded denote three pitches sounding together Aristoxenus wrote work entitled Harmonika Stoicheia which thought the first work European history written the subject harmony was not until the publication Rameaus Trait lharmonie Treatise Harmony 1722 that any text discussing musical practice made use the term the title although that work not the earliest record theoretical discussion the topic The underlying principle behind these texts that harmony sanctions harmoniousness sounds that please conforming certain preestablished compositional principles Current dictionary definitions while attempting give concise descriptions often highlight the ambiguity the term modern use Ambiguities tend arise from either aesthetic considerations for example the view that only pleasing concords may harmonious from the point view musical texture distinguishing between harmonic simultaneously sounding pitches and contrapuntal successively sounding tones the words Arnold Whittall While the entire history music theory appears depend just such distinction between harmony and counterpoint less evident that developments the nature musical composition down the centuries have presumed the interdependenceat times amounting integration other times source sustained tensionbetween the vertical and horizontal dimensions musical spacepageneeded The view that modern tonal harmony Western music began about 1600 commonplace music theory This usually accounted for the replacement horizontal contrapuntal composition common the music the Renaissance with new emphasis the vertical element composed music Modern theorists however tend see this unsatisfactory generalisation According Carl Dahlhaus was not that counterpoint was supplanted harmony Bachs tonal counterpoint surely less polyphonic than Palestrinas modal writing but that older type both counterpoint and vertical technique was succeeded newer type And harmony comprises not only the vertical structure chords but also their horizontal movement Like music whole harmony processpageneeded Descriptions and definitions harmony and harmonic practice may show bias towards European Western musical traditions For example South Asian art music Hindustani and Carnatic music frequently cited placing little emphasis what perceived western practice conventional harmony the underlying harmonic foundation for most South Asian music the drone held open fifth interval fourth interval that does not alter pitch throughout the course composition Pitch simultaneity particular rarely major consideration Nevertheless many other considerations pitch are relevant the music its theory and its structure such the complex system Rgas which combines both melodic and modal considerations and codifications within intricate pitch combinations that sound simultaneously occur Indian classical musicbut they are rarely studied teleological harmonic contrapuntal progressionsas with notated Western music This contrasting emphasis with regard Indian music particular manifests itself the different methods performance adopted Indian Music improvisation takes major role the structural framework piece whereas Western Music improvisation has been uncommon since the end the 19th century Where does occur Western music has the past the improvisation either embellishes prenotated music draws from musical models previously established notated compositions and therefore uses familiar harmonic schemes Nevertheless emphasis the precomposed European art music and the written theory surrounding shows considerable cultural bias The Grove Dictionary Music and Musicians Oxford University Press identifies this clearly Western culture the musics that are most dependent improvisation such jazz have traditionally been regarded inferior art music which precomposition considered paramount The conception musics that live oral traditions something composed with the use improvisatory techniques separates them from the higherstanding works that use notation Yet the evolution harmonic practice and language itself Western art music and was facilitated this process prior composition which permitted the study and analysis theorists and composers individual preconstructed works which pitches and some extent rhythms remained unchanged regardless the nature the performance Some traditions Western music performance composition and theory have specific rules harmony These rules are often described based natural properties such Pythagorean tunings law whole number ratios harmoniousness being inherent the ratios either perceptually themselves harmonics and resonances harmoniousness being inherent the quality sound with the allowable pitches and harmonies gaining their beauty simplicity from their closeness those properties This model provides that the minor seventh and major ninth are not dissonant are consonantcitation needed Early Western religious music often features parallel perfect intervals these intervals would preserve the clarity the original plainsong These works were created and performed cathedrals and made use the resonant modes their respective cathedrals create harmonies polyphony developed however the use parallel intervals was slowly replaced the English style consonance that used thirds and sixthswhen The English style was considered have sweeter sound and was better suited polyphony that offered greater linear flexibility partwriting Early music also forbade usage the tritone due its dissonance and composers often went considerable lengths via musica ficta avoid using the newer triadic harmonic system however the tritone became permissible the standardization functional dissonance made its use dominant chords desirablecitation needed Most harmony comes from two more notes sounding simultaneouslybut work can imply harmony with only one melodic line using arpeggios hocket Many pieces from the baroque period for solo string instrumentssuch Bachs Sonatas and partitas for solo violin and celloconvey subtle harmony through inference rather than full chordal structures These works create sense harmonies using arpeggiated chords and implied bass lines The implied basslines are created with low notes short duration that many listeners perceive being the bass note chordcitation needed Carl Dahlhaus 1990 distinguishes between coordinate and subordinate harmony Subordinate harmony the hierarchical tonality tonal harmony well known today Coordinate harmony the older Medieval and Renaissance tonalit ancienne The term meant signify that sonorities are linked one after the other without giving rise the impression goaldirected development first chord forms progression with second chord and second with third But the former chord progression independent the later one and vice versa Coordinate harmony follows direct adjacent relationships rather than indirect subordinate Interval cycles create symmetrical harmonies which have been extensively used the composers Alban Berg George Perle Arnold Schoenberg Bla Bartk and Edgard Varses Density 215 Close harmony and open harmony use close position and open position chords respectively See voicing music and close and open harmony Other types harmony are based upon the intervals the chords used that harmony Most chords western music are based tertian harmony chords built with the interval thirds the chord Major7 major third minor third and major third Other types harmony consist quartal and quintal harmony unison considered harmonic interval just like fifth third but unique that two identical notes produced together The unison component harmony important especially orchestration pop music unison singing usually called doubling technique The Beatles used many their earlier recordings type harmony singing unison playing the same notes often using different musical instruments the same time commonly called monophonic harmonization interval the relationship between two separate musical pitches For example the melody Twinkle Twinkle Little Star the first two notes the first twinkle and the second two notes the second twinkle are the interval one fifth What this means that the first two notes were the pitch the second two notes would the pitch Gfour scale notes seven chromatic notes perfect fifth above The following are common intervals Therefore the combination notes with their specific intervalsa chordcreates harmony For example chord there are three notes and The note the root The notes and provide harmony and dominant 7th chord the root with each subsequent note this case and provide the harmony the musical scale there are twelve pitches Each pitch referred degree the scale The names and are insignificant The intervals however are not Here example can seen note always corresponds certain degree the scale The tonic 1stdegree note can any the notes pitch classes the chromatic scale All the other notes fall into place For example when the tonic the fourth degree subdominant When the tonic the fourth degree While the note names remain constant they may refer different scale degrees implying different intervals with respect the tonic The great power this fact that any musical work can played sung any key the same piece music long the intervals are the samethus transposing the melody into the corresponding key When the intervals surpass the perfect Octave semitones these intervals are called compound intervals which include particularly the 9th 11th and 13th Intervalswidely used jazz and blues Music Compound Intervals are formed and named follows The reason the two numbers dont add correctly that one note counted twice Apart from this categorization intervals can also divided into consonant and dissonant explained the following paragraphs consonant intervals produce sensation relaxation and dissonant intervals sensation tension tonal music the term consonant also means brings resolution some degree least whereas dissonance requires resolution The consonant intervals are considered the perfect unison octave fifth fourth and major and minor third and sixth and their compound forms interval referred perfect when the harmonic relationship found the natural overtone series namely the unison octave fifth and fourth The other basic intervals second third sixth and seventh are called imperfect because the harmonic relationships are not found mathematically exact the overtone series classical music the perfect fourth above the bass may considered dissonant when its function contrapuntal Other intervals the second and the seventh and their compound forms are considered Dissonant and require resolution the produced tension and usually preparation depending the music style Note that the effect dissonance perceived relatively within musical context for example major seventh interval alone may perceived dissonant but the same interval part major seventh chord may sound relatively consonant tritone the interval the fourth step the seventh step the major scale sounds very dissonant alone but less within the context dominant seventh chord that example the Western tradition music after the seventeenth century harmony manipulated using chords which are combinations pitch classes tertian harmony named after the interval third the members chords are found and named stacking intervals the third starting with the root then the third above the root and the fifth above the root which third above the third etc Note that chord members are named after their interval above the root Dyads the simplest chords contain only two members see power chords chord with three members called triad because has three members not because necessarily built thirds see Quartal and quintal harmony for chords built with other intervals Depending the size the intervals being stacked different qualities chords are formed popular and jazz harmony chords are named their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities keep the nomenclature simple possible some defaults are accepted not tabulated here For example the chord members and form Major triad called default simply chord chord pronounced Aflat the members are and many types music notably baroque romantic modern and jazz chords are often augmented with tensions tension additional chord member that creates relatively dissonant interval relation the bass Following the tertian practice building chords stacking thirds the simplest first tension added triad stacking top the existing root third and fifth another third above the fifth giving new potentially dissonant member the interval seventh away from the root and therefore called the seventh the chord and producing fournote chord called seventh chord Depending the widths the individual thirds stacked build the chord the interval between the root and the seventh the chord may major minor diminished The interval augmented seventh reproduces the root and therefore left out the chordal nomenclature The nomenclature allows that default indicates chord with root third fifth and seventh spelled and Other types seventh chords must named more explicitly such Major spelled augmented here the word augmented applies the fifth not the seventh spelled etc For more complete exposition nomenclature see Chord music Continuing stack thirds top seventh chord produces extensions and brings the extended tensions upper tensions those more than octave above the root when stacked thirds the ninths elevenths and thirteenths This creates the chords named after them Note that except for dyads and triads tertian chord types are named for the interval the largest size and magnitude use the stack not for the number chord members thus ninth chord has five members 9th not nine Extensions beyond the thirteenth reproduce existing chord members and are usually left out the nomenclature Complex harmonies based extended chords are found abundance jazz lateromantic music modern orchestral works film music etc Typically the classical Common practice period dissonant chord chord with tension resolves consonant chord Harmonization usually sounds pleasant the ear when there balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds simple words that occurs when there balance between tense and relaxed moments For this reason usually tension prepared and then resolved where preparing tension means place series consonant chords that lead smoothly the dissonant chord this way the composer ensures introducing tension smoothly without disturbing the listener Once the piece reaches its subclimax the listener needs moment relaxation clear the tension which obtained playing consonant chord that resolves the tension the previous chords The clearing this tension usually sounds pleasant the listener though this not always the case latenineteenth century music such Tristan und Isolde Richard Wagner Harmony based consonance concept whose definition has changed various times during the history Western music psychological approach consonance continuous variable Consonance can vary across wide range chord may sound consonant for various reasons One lack perceptual roughness Roughness happens when partials frequency components lie within critical bandwidth which measure the ears ability separate different frequencies Critical bandwidth lies between and semitones high frequencies and becomes larger lower frequencies The roughness two simultaneous harmonic complex tones depends the amplitudes the harmonics and the interval between the tones The roughest interval the chromatic scale the minor second and its inversion the major seventh For typical spectral envelopes the central range the second roughest interval the major second and minor seventh followed the tritone the minor third major sixth the major third minor sixth and the perfect fourth fifth The second reason perceptual fusion chord fuses perception its overall spectrum similar harmonic series According this definition major triad fuses better than minor triad and majorminor seventh chord fuses better than majormajor seventh minorminor seventh These differences may not readily apparent tempered contexts but can explain why major triads are generally more prevalent than minor triads and majorminor sevenths generally more prevalent than other sevenths spite the dissonance the tritone interval mainstream tonal music course these comparisons depend style The third reason familiarity Chords that have often been heard musical contexts tend sound more consonant This principle explains the gradual historical increase harmonic complexity Western music For example around 1600 unprepared seventh chords gradually became familiar and were therefore gradually perceived more consonant Western music based major and minor triads The reason why these chords are central that they are consonant terms both fusion and lack roughness They fuse because they include the perfect fourthfifth interval They lack roughness because they lack major and minor second intervals other combination three tones the chromatic scale satisfies these criteria Postnineteenth century music has evolved the way that tension may less often prepared and less formally structured than Baroque Classical periods thus producing new styles such postRomantic harmony impressionism pantonality jazz and blues where dissonance may not prepared the way seen common practice era harmony jazz blues song the tonic chord that opens tune may dominant seventh chord jazz song may end what Classical music quite dissonant chord such altered dominant chord with sharpened eleventh notecitation needed The creation and destruction harmonic and statistical tensions essential the maintenance compositional drama Any composition improvisation which remains consistent and regular throughout for equivalent watching movie with only good guys eating cottage cheese
