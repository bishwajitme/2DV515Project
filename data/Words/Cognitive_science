Cognitive science the interdisciplinary scientific study the mind and its processes examines the nature the tasks and the functions cognition broad sense Cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior with focus how nervous systems represent process and transform information Mental faculties concern cognitive scientists include language perception memory attention reasoning and emotion understand these faculties cognitive scientists borrow from fields such linguistics psychology artificial intelligence philosophy neuroscience and anthropology The typical analysis cognitive science spans many levels organization from learning and decision logic and planning from neural circuitry modular brain organization The fundamental concept cognitive science that thinking can best understood terms representational structures the mind and computational procedures that operate those structures Simply put Cognitive Science the interdisciplinary study cognition humans animals and machines encompasses the traditional disciplines psychology computer science neuroscience anthropology linguistics and philosophy The goal cognitive science understand the principles intelligence with the hope that this will lead better comprehension the mind and learning and develop intelligent devicesThe cognitive sciences began intellectual movement the 1950s often referred the cognitive revolution central tenet cognitive science that complete understanding the mindbrain cannot attained studying only single level example would the problem remembering phone number and recalling later One approach understanding this process would study behavior through direct observation naturalistic observation person could presented with phone number and asked recall after some delay time then the accuracy the response could measured Another approach measure cognitive ability would study the firings individual neurons while person trying remember the phone number Neither these experiments its own would fully explain how the process remembering phone number works Even the technology map out every neuron the brain realtime were available and were known when each neuron fired would still impossible know how particular firing neurons translates into the observed behavior Thus understanding how these two levels relate each other imperative The Embodied Mind Cognitive Science and Human Experience says the new sciences the mind need enlarge their horizon encompass both lived human experience and the possibilities for transformation inherent human experience This can provided functional level account the process Studying particular phenomenon from multiple levels creates better understanding the processes that occur the brain give rise particular behaviorMarr gave famous description three levels analysis Cognitive science interdisciplinary field with contributors from various fields including psychology neuroscience linguistics philosophy mind computer science anthropology and biology Cognitive scientists work collectively hope understanding the mind and its interactions with the surrounding world much like other sciences The field regards itself compatible with the physical sciences and uses the scientific method well simulation modeling often comparing the output models with aspects human cognition Similarly the field psychology there some doubt whether there unified cognitive science which have led some researchers prefer cognitive sciences plural Many but not all who consider themselves cognitive scientists hold functionalist view the mindthe view that mental states and processes should explained their function what they According the multiple realizability account functionalism even nonhuman systems such robots and computers can ascribed having cognition The term cognitive cognitive science used for any kind mental operation structure that can studied precise terms Lakoff and Johnson 1999 This conceptualization very broad and should not confused with how cognitive used some traditions analytic philosophy where cognitive has only with formal rules and truth conditional semantics The earliest entries for the word cognitive the OED take mean roughly pertaining the action process knowing The first entry from 1586 shows the word was one time used the context discussions Platonic theories knowledge Most cognitive science however presumably not believe their field the study anything certain the knowledge sought Plato Cognitive science large field and covers wide array topics cognition However should recognized that cognitive science has not always been equally concerned with every topic that might bear relevance the nature and operation minds Among philosophers classical cognitivists have largely deemphasized avoided social and cultural factors emotion consciousness animal cognition and comparative and evolutionary psychologies However with the decline behaviorism internal states such affects and emotions well awareness and covert attention became approachable again For example situated and embodied cognition theories take into account the current state the environment well the role the body cognition With the newfound emphasis information processing observable behavior was longer the hallmark psychological theory but the modeling recording mental states Below are some the main topics that cognitive science concerned with This not exhaustive list See List cognitive science topics for list various aspects the field Artificial intelligence involves the study cognitive phenomena machines One the practical goals implement aspects human intelligence computers Computers are also widely used tool with which study cognitive phenomena Computational modeling uses simulations study how human intelligence may structured See Computational modeling There some debate the field whether the mind best viewed huge array small but individually feeble elements neurons collection higherlevel structures such symbols schemes plans and rules The former view uses connectionism study the mind whereas the latter emphasizes symbolic computations One way view the issue whether possible accurately simulate human brain computer without accurately simulating the neurons that make the human brain Attention the selection important information The human mind bombarded with millions stimuli and must have way deciding which this information process Attention sometimes seen spotlight meaning one can only shine the light particular set information Experiments that support this metaphor include the dichotic listening task Cherry 1957 and studies inattentional blindness Mack and Rock 1998 the dichotic listening task subjects are bombarded with two different messages one each ear and told focus only one the messages the end the experiment when asked about the content the unattended message subjects cannot report The ability learn and understand language extremely complex process Language acquired within the first few years life and all humans under normal circumstances are able acquire language proficiently major driving force the theoretical linguistic field discovering the nature that language must have the abstract order learned such fashion Some the driving research questions studying how the brain itself processes language include what extent linguistic knowledge innate learned Why more difficult for adults acquire secondlanguage than for infants acquire their firstlanguage and How are humans able understand novel sentences The study language processing ranges from the investigation the sound patterns speech the meaning words and whole sentences Linguistics often divides language processing into orthography phonetics phonology morphology syntax semantics and pragmatics Many aspects language can studied from each these components and from their interactionbettersourceneeded The study language processing cognitive science closely tied the field linguistics Linguistics was traditionally studied part the humanities including studies history art and literature the last fifty years more and more researchers have studied knowledge and use language cognitive phenomenon the main problems being how knowledge language can acquired and used and what precisely consists Linguists have found that while humans form sentences ways apparently governed very complex systems they are remarkably unaware the rules that govern their own speech Thus linguists must resort indirect methods determine what those rules might indeed rules such exist any event speech indeed governed rules they appear opaque any conscious consideration Learning and development are the processes which acquire knowledge and information over time Infants are born with little knowledge depending how knowledge defined yet they rapidly acquire the ability use language walk and recognize people and objects Research learning and development aims explain the mechanisms which these processes might take place major question the study cognitive development the extent which certain abilities are innate learned This often framed terms the nature and nurture debate The nativist view emphasizes that certain features are innate organism and are determined its genetic endowment The empiricist view the other hand emphasizes that certain abilities are learned from the environment Although clearly both genetic and environmental input needed for child develop normally considerable debate remains about how genetic information might guide cognitive development the area language acquisition for example some such Steven Pinker have argued that specific information containing universal grammatical rules must contained the genes whereas others such Jeffrey Elman and colleagues Rethinking Innateness have argued that Pinkers claims are biologically unrealistic They argue that genes determine the architecture learning system but that specific facts about how grammar works can only learned result experience Memory allows store information for later retrieval Memory often thought consisting both longterm and shortterm store Longterm memory allows store information over prolonged periods days weeks years not yet know the practical limit longterm memory capacity Shortterm memory allows store information over short time scales seconds minutes Memory also often grouped into declarative and procedural forms Declarative memorygrouped into subsets semantic and episodic forms memoryrefers our memory for facts and specific knowledge specific meanings and specific experiences Who was the first president the USA What did eat for breakfast four days ago Procedural memory allows remember actions and motor sequences how ride bicycle and often dubbed implicit knowledge memory Cognitive scientists study memory just psychologists but tend focus more how memory bears cognitive processes and the interrelationship between cognition and memory One example this could what mental processes does person through retrieve longlost memory what differentiates between the cognitive process recognition seeing hints something before remembering memory context and recall retrieving memory fillintheblank Perception the ability take information via the senses and process some way Vision and hearing are two dominant senses that allow perceive the environment Some questions the study visual perception for example include How are able recognize objects Why perceive continuous visual environment even though only see small bits any one time One tool for studying visual perception looking how people process optical illusions The image the right Necker cube example bistable percept that the cube can interpreted being oriented two different directions The study haptic tactile olfactory and gustatory stimuli also fall into the domain perception Action taken refer the output system humans this accomplished through motor responses Spatial planning and movement speech production and complex motor movements are all aspects action Consciousness the awareness whether something external object something within oneself This helps the mind having the ability experience feel sense self Many different methodologies are used study cognitive science the field highly interdisciplinary research often cuts across multiple areas study drawing research methods from psychology neuroscience computer science and systems theory order have description what constitutes intelligent behavior one must study behavior itself This type research closely tied that cognitive psychology and psychophysics measuring behavioral responses different stimuli one can understand something about how those stimuli are processed Lewandowski and Strohmetz 2009 review collection innovative uses behavioral measurement psychology including behavioral traces behavioral observations and behavioral choice Behavioral traces are pieces evidence that indicate behavior occurred but the actor not present litter parking lot readings electric meter Behavioral observations involve the direct witnessing the actor engaging the behavior watching how close person sits next another person Behavioral choices are when person selects between two more options voting behavior choice punishment for another participant Brain imaging involves analyzing activity within the brain while performing various tasks This allows link behavior and brain function help understand how information processed Different types imaging techniques vary their temporal timebased and spatial locationbased resolution Brain imaging often used cognitive neuroscience Computational models require mathematically and logically formal representation problem Computer models are used the simulation and experimental verification different specific and general properties intelligence Computational modeling can help understand the functional organization particular cognitive phenomenonApproaches cognitive modeling can categorized symbolic abstract mental functions intelligent mind means symbols subsymbolic the neural and associative properties the human brain and across the symbolicsubsymbolic border including hybrid All the above approaches tend generalized the form integrated computational models syntheticabstract intelligence order applied the explanation and improvement individual and socialorganizational decisionmaking and reasoning Research methods borrowed directly from neuroscience and neuropsychology can also help understand aspects intelligence These methods allow understand how intelligent behavior implemented physical system Cognitive science has given rise models human cognitive bias and risk perception and has been influential the development behavioral finance part economics has also given rise new theory the philosophy mathematics and many theories artificial intelligence persuasion and coercion has made its presence known the philosophy language and epistemology well constituting substantial wing modern linguistics Fields cognitive science have been influential understanding the brains particular functional systems and functional deficits ranging from speech production auditory processing and visual perception has made progress understanding how damage particular areas the brain affect cognition and has helped uncover the root causes and results specific dysfunction such dyslexia anopia and hemispatial neglect The cognitive sciences began intellectual movement the 1950s called the cognitive revolution Cognitive science has prehistory traceable back ancient Greek philosophical texts see Platos Meno and Aristotles Anima and includes writers such Descartes David Hume Immanuel Kant Benedict Spinoza Nicolas Malebranche Pierre Cabanis Leibniz and John Locke However although these early writers contributed greatly the philosophical discovery mind and this would ultimately lead the development psychology they were working with entirely different set tools and core concepts than those the cognitive scientist The modern culture cognitive science can traced back the early cyberneticists the 1930s and 1940s such Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts who sought understand the organizing principles the mind McCulloch and Pitts developed the first variants what are now known artificial neural networks models computation inspired the structure biological neural networks Another precursor was the early development the theory computation and the digital computer the 1940s and 1950s Kurt Gdel Alonzo Church Alan Turing and John von Neumann were instrumental these developments The modern computer Von Neumann machine would play central role cognitive science both metaphor for the mind and tool for investigation The first instance cognitive science experiments being done academic institution took place MIT Sloan School Management established JCR Licklider working within the psychology department and conducting experiments using computer memory models for human cognition 1959 Noam Chomsky published scathing review Skinners book Verbal Behavior the time Skinners behaviorist paradigm dominated the field psychology within the United States Most psychologists focused functional relations between stimulus and response without positing internal representations Chomsky argued that order explain language needed theory like generative grammar which not only attributed internal representations but characterized their underlying order The term cognitive science was coined Christopher LonguetHiggins his 1973 commentary the Lighthill report which concerned the thencurrent state Artificial Intelligence research the same decade the journal Cognitive Science and the Cognitive Science Society were founded The founding meeting the Cognitive Science Society was held the University California San Diego 1979 which resulted cognitive science becoming internationally visible enterprise 1972 Hampshire College started the first undergraduate education program Cognitive Science led Neil Stillings 1982 with assistance from Professor Stillings Vassar College became the first institution the world grant undergraduate degree Cognitive Science 1986 the first Cognitive Science Department the world was founded the University California San Diego the 1970s and early 1980s access computers increased artificial intelligence research expanded Researchers such Marvin Minsky would write computer programs languages such LISP attempt formally characterize the steps that human beings went through for instance making decisions and solving problems the hope better understanding human thought and also the hope creating artificial minds This approach known symbolic Eventually the limits the symbolic research program became apparent For instance seemed unrealistic comprehensively list human knowledge form usable symbolic computer program The late 80s and 90s saw the rise neural networks and connectionism research paradigm Under this point view often attributed James McClelland and David Rumelhart the mind could characterized set complex associations represented layered network Critics argue that there are some phenomena which are better captured symbolic models and that connectionist models are often complex have little explanatory power Recently symbolic and connectionist models have been combined making possible take advantage both forms explanation While both connectionism and symbolic approaches have proven useful for testing various hypotheses and exploring approaches understanding aspects cognition and lower level brain functions neither are biologically realistic and therefore both suffer from lack neuroscientific plausibility Connectionism has proven useful for exploring computationally how cognition emerges development and occurs the human brain and has provided alternatives strictly domainspecific domain general approaches For example scientists such Jeff Elman Liz Bates and Annette KarmiloffSmith have posited that networks the brain emerge from the dynamic interaction between them and environmental input Some the more recognized names cognitive science are usually either the most controversial the most cited Within philosophy some familiar names include Daniel Dennett who writes from computational systems perspective John Searle known for his controversial Chinese room argument and Jerry Fodor who advocates functionalism Others include David Chalmers who advocates Dualism and also known for articulating the hard problem consciousness and Douglas Hofstadter famous for writing Gdel Escher Bach which questions the nature words and thought the realm linguistics Noam Chomsky and George Lakoff have been influential both have also become notable political commentators artificial intelligence Marvin Minsky Herbert Simon and Allen Newell are prominent Popular names the discipline psychology include George Miller James McClelland Philip JohnsonLaird and Steven Pinker Anthropologists Dan Sperber Edwin Hutchins and Scott Atran have been involved collaborative projects with cognitive and social psychologists political scientists and evolutionary biologists attempts develop general theories culture formation religion and political association Computational theories with models and simulations have also been developed the likes David Rumelhart James McClelland Philip JohnsonLaird and Other contributions have been made Marvin Minsky and Noam Chomsky
