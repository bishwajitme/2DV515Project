The ancient Greek drama was theatrical culture that flourished ancient Greece from 700 The citystate Athens which became significant cultural political and military power during this period was its center where was institutionalised part festival called the Dionysia which honored the god Dionysus Tragedy late 500 comedy 490 and the satyr play were the three dramatic genres emerge there Athens exported the festival its numerous colonies The word tragodia from which the word tragedy derived compound two Greek words tragos goat and ode meaning song from aeidein singThis etymology indicates link with the practices the ancient Dionysian cults impossible however know with certainty how these fertility rituals became the basis for tragedy and comedy The classical Greek valued the power spoken word and was their main method communication and storytelling Bahn and Bahn write Greeks the spoken word was living thing and infinitely preferable the dead symbols written language Socrates himself believed that once something has been written down lost its ability for change and growth For these reasons among many others oral storytelling flourished Greece Greek tragedy know was created Athens around the time 532 when Thespis was the earliest recorded actor Being winner the first theatrical contest held Athens was the exarchon leader the dithyrambs performed and around Attica especially the rural Dionysia Thespis time the dithyramb had evolved far away from its cult roots Under the influence heroic epic Doric choral lyric and the innovations the poet Arion had become narrative balladlike genre Because these Thespis often called the Father Tragedy however his importance disputed and Thespis sometimes listed late 16th the chronological order Greek tragedians the statesman Solon for example credited with creating poems which characters speak with their own voice and spoken performances Homers epics rhapsodes were popular festivals prior 534 Thus Thespiss true contribution drama unclear best but his name has been given longer life English common term for performer thespian The dramatic performances were important the Athenians this made clear the creation tragedy competition and festival the City Dionysia This was organized possibly foster loyalty among the tribes Attica recently created Cleisthenes The festival was created roughly around 508 While drama texts exist from the sixth century know the names three competitors besides Thespis Choerilus Pratinas and Phrynichus Each credited with different innovations the field More known about Phrynichus won his first competition between 511 and 508 produced tragedies themes and subjects later exploited the golden age such the Danaids Phoenician Women and Alcestis was the first poet know use historical subject his Fall Miletus produced 4932 chronicled the fate the town Miletus after was conquered the Persians Herodotus reports that the Athenians made clear their deep grief for the taking Miletus many ways but especially this when Phrynichus wrote play entitled The Fall Miletus and produced the whole theatre fell weeping they fined Phrynichus thousand drachmas for bringing mind calamity that affected them personally and forbade the performance that play forever also thought the first use female characters though not female performers Until the Hellenistic period all tragedies were unique pieces written honour Dionysus and played only once that today primarily have the pieces that were still remembered well enough have been repeated when the repetition old tragedies became fashionable the accidents survival well the subjective tastes the Hellenistic librarians later Greek history also played role what survived from this period After the Great Destruction Athens the Persian Empire 480 BCE the town and acropolis were rebuilt and theatre became formalized and even greater part Athenian culture and civic pride This century normally regarded the Golden Age Greek drama The centrepiece the annual Dionysia which took place once winter and once spring was competition between three tragic playwrights the Theatre Dionysus Each submitted three tragedies plus satyr play comic burlesque version mythological subject Beginning first competition 486 each playwright submitted comedy Aristotle claimed that Aeschylus added the second actor deuteragonist and that Sophocles introduced the third tritagonist Apparently the Greek playwrights never used more than three actors based what known about Greek theatre Tragedy and comedy were viewed completely separate genres and plays ever merged aspects the two Satyr plays dealt with the mythological subject matter the tragedies but purely comedic manner The power Athens declined following its defeat the Peloponnesian War against the Spartans From that time the theatre started performing old tragedies again Although its theatrical traditions seem have lost their vitality Greek theatre continued into the Hellenistic period the period following Alexander the Greats conquests the fourth century BCE However the primary Hellenistic theatrical form was not tragedy but New Comedy comic episodes about the lives ordinary citizens The only extant playwright from the period Menander One New Comedys most important contributions was its influence Roman comedy influence that can seen the surviving works Plautus and Terence The plays had chorus from people who performed the plays verse accompanied music beginning the morning and lasting until the evening The performance space was simple circular space the orchestra where the chorus danced and sang The orchestra which had average diameter feet was situated flattened terrace the foot hill the slope which produced natural theatron literally seeing place Later the term theatre came applied the whole area theatron orchestra and sken The coryphaeus was the head chorus member who could enter the story character able interact with the characters play The theatres were originally built very large scale accommodate the large number people stage well the large number people the audience fourteen thousand Mathematics played large role the construction these theatres their designers had able create acoustics them such that the actors voices could heard throughout the theatre including the very top row seats The Greeks understanding acoustics compares very favourably with the current state the art The first seats Greek theatres other than just sitting the ground were wooden but around 499 BCE the practice inlaying stone blocks into the side the hill create permanent stable seating became more common They were called the prohedria and reserved for priests and few most respected citizens 465 BCE the playwrights began using backdrop scenic wall which hung stood behind the orchestra which also served area where actors could change their costumes was known the skn from which the word scene derives The death character was always heard behind the skn for was considered inappropriate show killing view the audiencecitation needed Conversely there are scholarly arguments that death Greek tragedy was portrayed off stage primarily because dramatic considerations and not prudishness sensitivity the audience 425 stone scene wall called paraskenia became common supplement skn the theatres paraskenia was long wall with projecting sides which may have had doorways for entrances and exits Just behind the paraskenia was the proskenion The proskenion front the scene was beautiful and was similar the modern day proscenium Greek theatres also had tall arched entrances called parodoi eisodoi through which actors and chorus members entered and exited the orchestra the end the 5th century around the time the Peloponnesian War the skn the back wall was two stories high The upper story was called the episkenion Some theatres also had raised speaking place the orchestra called the logeion There were several scenic elements commonly used Greek theatre The Ancient Greek term for mask prosopon lit face and was significant element the worship Dionysus Athens likely used ceremonial rites and celebrations Most the evidence comes from only few vase paintings the 5th century such one showing mask the god suspended from tree with decorated robe hanging below and dancing and the Pronomos vase which depicts actors preparing for Satyr play physical evidence remains available the masks were made organic materials and not considered permanent objects ultimately being dedicated the altar Dionysus after performances Nevertheless the mask known have been used since the time Aeschylus and considered one the iconic conventions classical Greek theatre Masks were also made for members the chorus who play some part the action and provide commentary the events which they are caught Although there are twelve fifteen members the tragic chorus they all wear the same mask because they are considered representing one character Illustrations theatrical masks from 5th century display helmetlike masks covering the entire face and head with holes for the eyes and small aperture for the mouth well integrated wig These paintings never show actual masks the actors performance they are most often shown being handled the actors before after performance that liminal space between the audience and the stage between myth and reality Effectively the mask transformed the actor much memorization the text Therefore performance ancient Greece did not distinguish the masked actor from the theatrical character The maskmakers were called skeuopoios maker the properties thus suggesting that their role encompassed multiple duties and tasks The masks were most likely made out light weight organic materials like stiffened linen leather wood cork with the wig consisting human animal hair Due the visual restrictions imposed these masks was imperative that the actors hear order orient and balance themselves Thus believed that the ears were covered substantial amounts hair and not the helmetmask itself The mouth opening was relatively small preventing the mouth seen during performances Vervain and Wiles posit that this small size discourages the idea that the mask functioned megaphone originally presented the 1960s Greek maskmaker Thanos Vovolis suggests that the mask serves resonator for the head thus enhancing vocal acoustics and altering its quality This leads increased energy and presence allowing for the more complete metamorphosis the actor into his character large openair theatre like the Theatre Dionysus Athens the classical masks were able create sense dread the audience creating large scale panic especially since they had intensely exaggerated facial features and expressions They enabled actor appear and reappear several different roles thus preventing the audience from identifying the actor one specific character Their variations help the audience distinguish sex age and social status addition revealing change particular characters appearance Oedipus after blinding himself Unique masks were also created for specific characters and events play such The Furies Aeschylus Eumenides and Pentheus and Cadmus Euripides The Bacchae Worn the chorus the masks created sense unity and uniformity while representing multivoiced persona single organism and simultaneously encouraged interdependency and heightened sensitivity between each individual the group Only actors were allowed the stage one time and masks permitted quick transitions from one character another There were only male actors but masks allowed them play female characters The actors these plays that had tragic roles wore boots called cothurni that elevated them above the other actors The actors with comedic roles only wore thin soled shoe called sock For this reason dramatic art sometimes alluded Sock and Buskin Melpomene the muse tragedy and often depicted holding the tragic mask and wearing cothurni Thalia the muse comedy and similarly associated with the mask comedy and the comedic socks Male actors playing female roles would wear wooden structure their chests posterneda imitate the look breasts and another structure their stomachs progastreda make them appear softer and more lady like They would also wear white body stockings under their costumes make their skin appear fairer Most costuming detail comes from pottery paintings from that time costumes and masks were fabricated out disposable material there are little remains any costume from that time The biggest source information the Pronomos Vase where actors are painted shows after party Costuming would give off sense character gender age social status and class For example characters higher class would dressed nicer clothing although everyone was dressed fairly nicely Contrary popular belief they did not dress only rags and sandals they wanted impress Some examples Greek theatre costuming include long robes called the chiton that reached the floor for actors playing gods heroes and old men Actors playing Goddesses and women characters that held lot power wore purples and golds Actors playing Queens and Princesses wore long cloaks that dragged the ground and were decorated with gold stars and other jewels and warriors were dressed variety armor and wore helmets adorned with plumes Costumes were supposed colourful and obvious easily seen every seat the audience
