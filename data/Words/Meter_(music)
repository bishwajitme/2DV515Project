music metre meter refers the regularly recurring patterns and accents such bars and beats Unlike rhythm metric onsets are not necessarily sounded but are nevertheless expected the listener variety systems exist throughout the world for organising and playing metrical music such the Indian system tala and similar systems Arabian and African music Western music inherited the concept metre from poetry Scholes 1977 Latham 2002b where denotes the number lines verse the number syllables each line and the arrangement those syllables long short accented unaccented Scholes 1977 Latham 2002b The first coherent system rhythmic notation modern Western music was based rhythmic modes derived from the basic types metrical unit the quantitative meter classical ancient Greek and Latin poetry Hoppin 1978 221 Later music for dances such the pavane and galliard consisted musical phrases accompany fixed sequence basic steps with defined tempo and time signature The English word measure originally exact just amount time came denote either poetic rhythm bar music else entire melodic verse dance MerriamWebster 2015 involving sequences notes words movements that may last four eight sixteen bars The term metre not very precisely defined Scholes 1977 Stewart MacPherson preferred speak time and rhythmic shape MacPherson 1930 while Imogen Holst preferred measured rhythm Holst 1963 However Justin London has written book about musical metre which involves our initial perception well subsequent anticipation series beats that abstract from the rhythm surface the music unfolds time London 2004 This perception and abstraction rhythmic bar the foundation human instinctive musical participation when divide series identical clockticks into ticktockticktock Scholes 1977 Rhythms recurrence arise from the interaction two levels motion the faster providing the pulse and the slower organizing the beats into repetitive groups Yeston 1976 5052 his book The Rhythms Tonal Music Joel Lester notes that once metric hierarchy has been established listeners will maintain that organization long minimal evidence present Lester 1986 Meter may defined regular recurring pattern strong and weak beats This recurring pattern durations identified the beginning composition meter signature time signature Although meter generally indicated time signatures important realize that meter not simply matter notation Benward and Saker 2003 definition musical metre requires the possibility identifying repeating pattern accented pulses pulsegroup which corresponds the foot poetry Frequently pulsegroup can identified taking the accented beat the first pulse the group and counting the pulses until the next accent MacPherson 1930 Scholes 1977 Frequently metres can broken down into pattern duples and triples MacPherson 1930 Scholes 1977 The level musical organisation implied musical metre includes the most elementary levels musical form MacPherson 1930 Metrical rhythm measured rhythm and free rhythm are general classes rhythm and may distinguished all aspects temporality Cooper 1973 Some music including chant has freer rhythm like the rhythm prose compared that verse Scholes 1977 Some music such some graphically scored works since the 1950s and nonEuropean music such Honkyoku repertoire for shakuhachi may considered ametric Karpinski 2000 The music term senza misura Italian for without metre meaning play without beat using time bar how long will take play the bar Forney and Machlis 2007pageneeded Metric structure includes metre tempo and all rhythmic aspects that produce temporal regularity structure against which the foreground details durational patterns any piece music are projected Wittlich 1975 chapt Metric levels may distinguished the beat level the metric level which pulses are heard the basic time unit the piece Faster levels are division levels and slower levels are multiple levels Wittlich 1975 chapt rhythmic unit durational pattern which occupies period time equivalent pulse pulses underlying metric level duple metre each measure divided into two beats multiple thereof quadruple metre For example the time signature each bar contains two quarternote beats the time signature each bar contains two dottedquarternote beats Corresponding quadruple metres are which has four quarternote beats per measure and 128 which has four dottedquarternote beats per bar Triple metre metre which each bar divided into three beats multiple thereof For example the time signature each bar contains three quarternote beats and with time signature each bar contains three dottedquarter beats Metres with more than four beats are called quintuple metres sextuple metres septuple metres etc Simple metre and compound metre are distinguished the way the beats are subdivided Simple metre simple time metre which each beat the bar divides naturally into two opposed three equal parts The top number the time signature will etc For example the time signature each bar contains three quarternote beats and each those beats divides into two eighth notes making simple metre More specifically simple triple metre because there are three beats each measure simple duple two beats simple quadruple four are also common metres Compound metre compound time metre which each beat the bar divides naturally into three equal parts That each beat contains triple pulse Latham 2002a The top number the time signature will etc Compound metres are written with time signature that shows the number divisions beats each bar opposed the number beats For example compound duple two beats each divided into three written time signature with numerator six for example Contrast this with the time signature which also assigns six eighth notes each measure but convention connotes simple triple time quarternote beats Examples compound metre include compound duple metre compound triple metre and 128 compound quadruple metre Although and are not confused they use bars the same length easy slip between them just shifting the location the accents This interpretational switch has been exploited for example Leonard Bernstein the song America Compound metre divided into three parts could theoretically transcribed into musically equivalent simple metre using triplets Likewise simple metre can shown compound through duples practice however this rarely done because disrupts conducting patterns when the tempo changes When conducting conductors typically provide two beats per bar however all six beats may performed when the tempo very slow Compound time associated with lilting and dancelike qualities Folk dances often use compound time Many Baroque dances are often compound time some gigues the courante and sometimes the passepied and the siciliana The concept metre music derives large part from the poetic metre song and includes not only the basic rhythm the foot pulsegroup figure used but also the rhythmic formal arrangement such figures into musical phrases lines couplets and such phrases into melodies passages sections stanzas verses give what Holst 1963 calls the time pattern any song See also Form musical passage Traditional and popular songs may draw heavily upon limited range metres leading interchangeability melodies Early hymnals commonly did not include musical notation but simply texts that could sung any tune known the singers that had matching metre For example The Blind Boys Alabama rendered the hymn Amazing Grace the setting The Animals version the folk song The House the Rising Sun This possible because the texts share popular basic fourline quatrain verseform called ballad metre hymnals common metre the four lines having syllablecount 8686 Hymns Ancient and Modern Revised the rhymescheme usually following suit ABAB There generally pause the melody cadence the end the shorter lines that the underlying musical metre 8888 beats the cadences dividing this musically into two symmetrical normal phrases four bars each MacPherson 1930 some regional music for example Balkan music like Bulgarian music and the Macedonian 32232 metre wealth irregular compound metres are used Other terms for this are additive metre London 2001 and imperfect time Read 1964 147not citation given Metre often essential any style dance music such the waltz tango that has instantly recognizable patterns beats built upon characteristic tempo and barThe Imperial Society Teachers Dancing 1983 defines the tango for example danced time approximately beats per minute The basic slow step forwards backwards lasting for one beat called slow that full rightleft step equal one bar But stepfigures such turns the corte and walkins also require quick steps half the duration each entire figure requiring slow beats Such figures may then amalgamated create series movements that may synchronise entire musical section piece This can thought equivalent prosody see also prosody music music the common practice period about 16001900 there are four different families time signature common use the beat divided into two the metre simple divided into three compound each bar divided into two duple and into three triple Some people also label quadruple while some consider two duples Any other division considered additively bar five beats may broken into dupletriple 12123 tripleduple 12312 depending accent However some music especially faster tempos may treated one unit five 20thcentury concert music became more common switch metrethe end Igor Stravinskys The Rite Spring shown below example This practice sometimes called mixed metres metric modulation modulation from one metric unit metre another The use asymmetrical rhythms sometimes called aksak rhythm the Turkish word for limping also became more common the 20th century such metres include quintuple well more complex additive metres along the lines 223 time where each bar has two 2beat units and 3beat unit with stress the beginning each unit Similar metres are often used Bulgarian folk dances and Indian classical music Hypermetre largescale metre opposed surfacelevel metre created hypermeasures which consist hyperbeats Stein 2005 329 Hypermeter meter with all its inherent characteristics the level where bars act beats Neal 2000 115 For example the fourbar hyperbar the prototypical structure for country music and against which country songs work Neal 2000 115 some styles two and fourbar hypermetres are common The term was coined together with hypermeasures Edward Cone 1968 who regarded applying relatively small scale conceiving still larger kind gestural rhythm imparting sense extended upbeat followed its downbeat Berry and Van Solkema 2013 5vi London 2012 contends that terms multiple and simultaneous levels metrical entrainment evenly spaced temporal events that internalize and come expect there inprinciple distinction between metre and hypermetre instead they are the same phenomenon occurring different levels Lee 1985verification needed and Middleton have described musical metre terms deep structure using generative concepts show how different metres etc generate many different surface rhythms For example the first phrase The Beatles Hard Days Night excluding the syncopation night may generated from its metre 44Middleton 1990 211verification needed The syncopation may then added moving night forward one eighth note and the first phrase generated Playhelpinfo With polymetre the bar sizes differ but the beat remains constant Since the beat the same the various metres eventually agree Four bars seven bars example the second moment titled Scherzo polimetrico Edmund Rubbras Second String Quartet 1951 which constant triplet texture holds together overlapping bars 128 and 218 and barlines rarely coincide all four instruments Rubbra 1953 With polyrhythm the number beats varies within fixed bar length For example polyrhythm one part plays while the other plays but the beats are stretched that three beats are played the same time four beats More generally sometimes rhythms are combined way that neither tactus nor bar preservingthe beat differs and the bar size also differs See Polytempi Research into the perception polymetre shows that listeners often either extract composite pattern that fitted metric framework focus one rhythmic stream while treating others noise This consistent with the Gestalt
