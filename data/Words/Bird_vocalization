Bird vocalization includes both bird calls and bird songs nontechnical use bird songs are the bird sounds that are melodious the human ear ornithology and birding songs relatively complex vocalizations are distinguished function from calls relatively simple vocalizations The distinction between songs and calls based upon complexity length and context Songs are longer and more complex and are associated with courtship and mating while calls tend serve such functions alarms keeping members flock contact Other authorities such Howell and Webb 1995 make the distinction based function that short vocalizations such those pigeons and even nonvocal sounds such the drumming woodpeckers and the winnowing snipes wings display flight are considered songs Still others require song have syllabic diversity and temporal regularity akin the repetitive and transformative patterns that define music generally agreed upon birding and ornithology which sounds are songs and which are calls and good field guide will differentiate between the two Bird song best developed the order Passeriformes Some groups are nearly voiceless producing only percussive and rhythmic sounds such the storks which clatter their bills some manakins Pipridae the males have evolved several mechanisms for mechanical sound production including mechanisms for stridulation not unlike those found some insects Song usually delivered from prominent perches although some species may sing when flying The production sounds mechanical means opposed the use the syrinx has been termed variously instrumental music Charles Darwin mechanical sounds and more recently sonation The term sonate has been defined the act producing nonvocal sounds that are intentionally modulated communicative signals produced using nonsyringeal structures such the bill wings tail feet and body feathers extratropical Eurasia and the Americas almost all song produced male birds however the tropics and greater extent the desert belts Australia and Africa more typical for females sing much males These differences have been known for long time and are generally attributed the much less regular and seasonal climate Australian and African arid zones requiring that birds breed any time when conditions are favourable although they cannot breed many years because food supply never increases above minimal level With aseasonal irregular breeding both sexes must brought into breeding condition and vocalisation especially duetting serves this purpose The high frequency female vocalisations the tropics Australia and Southern Africa may also relate very low mortality rates producing much stronger pairbonding and territoriality The avian vocal organ called the syrinx bony structure the bottom the trachea unlike the larynx the top the mammalian trachea The syrinx and sometimes surrounding air sac resonate sound waves that are made membranes past which the bird forces air The bird controls the pitch changing the tension the membranes and controls both pitch and volume changing the force exhalation can control the two sides the trachea independently which how some species can produce two notes once One the two main functions bird song mate attraction Scientists hypothesize that bird song evolved through sexual selection and experiments suggest that the quality bird song may good indicator fitness Experiments also suggest that parasites and diseases may directly affect song characteristics such song rate which thereby act reliable indicators health The song repertoire also appears indicate fitness some species The ability male birds hold and advertise territories using song also demonstrates their fitness Therefore female bird may select males based the quality their songs and the size their song repertoire The second principal function bird song territory defense Territorial birds will interact with each other using song negotiate territory boundaries Since song may reliable indicator quality individuals may able discern the quality rivals and prevent energetically costly fight birds with song repertoires individuals may share the same song type and use these song types for more complex communication Some birds will respond shared song type with songtype match with the same song type This may aggressive signal however results are mixed Birds may also interact using repertoirematches wherein bird responds with song type that its rivals repertoire but not the song that currently singing This may less aggressive act than songtype matching Song complexity also linked male territorial defense with more complex songs being perceived greater territorial threat Communication through bird calls can between individuals the same species even across species Birds communicate alarm through vocalizations and movements that are specific the threat and bird alarms can understood other animal species including other birds order identify and protect against the specific threat Mobbing calls are used recruit individuals area where owl other predator may present These calls are characterized widefrequency spectra sharp onset and termination and repetitiveness that are common across species and are believed helpful other potential mobbers being easy locate The alarm calls most species the other hand are characteristically highpitched making the caller difficult locate Individual birds may sensitive enough identify each other through their calls Many birds that nest colonies can locate their chicks using their calls Calls are sometimes distinctive enough for individual identification even human researchers ecological studies Many birds engage duet calls some cases the duets are perfectly timed appear almost one call This kind calling termed antiphonal duetting Such duetting noted wide range families including quails bushshrikes babblers such the scimitar babblers some owls and parrots territorial songbirds birds are more likely countersing when they have been aroused simulated intrusion into their territory This implies role intraspecies aggressive competition Sometimes songs vocalized the postbreeding season act cue conspecific eavesdroppers blackthroated blue warblers males that have bred and reproduced successfully sing their offspring influence their vocal development while males that have failed reproduce usually abandon the nests and stay silent The postbreeding song therefore inadvertently informs the unsuccessful males particular habitats that have higher likelihood reproductive success The social communication vocalization provides shortcut locating high quality habitats and saves the trouble directly assessing various vegetation structures Some birds are excellent vocal mimics some tropical species mimics such the drongos may have role the formation mixedspecies foraging flocks Vocal mimicry can include conspecifics other species even manmade sounds Many hypotheses have been made the functions vocal mimicry including suggestions that they may involved sexual selection acting indicator fitness help brood parasites protect against predation but strong support lacking for any function Many birds especially those that nest cavities are known produce snakelike hissing sound that may help deter predators close range Some cavedwelling species including the oilbird and swiftlets Collocalia and Aerodramus spp use audible sound with the majority sonic location occurring between and 5kHz echolocate the darkness caves The only bird known make use infrasound about 20Hz the western capercaillie The hearing range birds from below 50Hz infrasound around 12kHz with maximum sensitivity between and 5kHz The black jacobin exceptional producing sounds about 118 kHz not known they can hear these sounds The range frequencies which birds call environment varies with the quality habitat and the ambient sounds The acoustic adaptation hypothesis predicts that narrow bandwidths low frequencies and long elements and interelement intervals should found habitats with complex vegetation structures which would absorb and muffle sounds while high frequencies broad bandwidth highfrequency modulations trills and short elements and interelements may expected open habitats without obstructive vegetation Low frequency songs are optimal for obstructed densely vegetated habitats because low frequency slowly modulated song elements are less susceptible signal degradation means reverberations off soundreflecting vegetation High frequency calls with rapid modulations are optimal for open habitats because they degrade less across open space The acoustic adaptation hypothesis also states that song characteristics may take advantage beneficial acoustic properties the environment Narrowfrequency bandwidth notes are increased volume and length reverberations densely vegetated habitats has been hypothesized that the available frequency range partitioned and birds call that overlap between different species frequency and time reduced This idea has been termed the acoustic niche Birds sing louder and higher pitch urban areas where there ambient lowfrequency noise Traffic noise was found decrease reproductive success the great tit Parsus major due the overlap acoustic frequency increase song volume restored fitness birds urban areas did higher frequency songs The songs different species birds vary and are generally typical the species Species vary greatly the complexity their songs and the number distinct kinds song they sing 3000 the brown thrasher individuals within some species vary the same way few species such lyrebirds and mockingbirds songs imbed arbitrary elements learned the individuals lifetime form mimicry though maybe better called appropriation Ehrlich the bird does not pass for another species early 1773 was established that birds learned calls and crossfostering experiments succeeded making linnet Acanthis cannabina learn the song skylark Alauda arvensis many species appears that although the basic song the same for all members the species young birds learn some details their songs from their fathers and these variations build over generations form dialects Song learning juvenile birds occurs two stages sensory learning which involves the juvenile listening the father other conspecific bird and memorizing the spectral and temporal qualities the song song template and sensorimotor learning which involves the juvenile bird producing its own vocalizations and practicing its song until accurately matches the memorized song template During the sensorimotor learning phase song production begins with highly variable subvocalizations called subsong which akin babbling human infantsSoon after the juvenile song shows certain recognizable characteristics the imitated adult song but still lacks the stereotypy the crystallized song this called plastic song After two three months song learning and rehearsal depending species the juvenile produces crystallized song characterized spectral and temporal stereotypy very low variability syllable production and syllable order Some birds such zebra finches which are the most popular species for birdsong research have overlapping sensory and sensorimotor learning stages Research has indicated that birds acquisition song form motor learning that involves regions the basal ganglia Further the PDP see Neuroanatomy below has been considered homologous mammalian motor pathway originating the cerebral cortex and descending through the brain stem while the AFP has been considered homologous the mammalian cortical pathway through the basal ganglia and thalamus Models birdsong motor learning can useful developing models for how humans learn speech some species such zebra finches learning song limited the first year they are termed agelimited closeended learners Other species such the canaries can develop new songs even sexually mature adults these are termed openended learners Researchers have hypothesized that learned songs allow the development more complex songs through cultural interaction thus allowing intraspecies dialects that help birds identify kin and adapt their songs different acoustic environments The acquisition and learning bird song involves group distinct brain areas that are aligned two connecting pathways The posterior descending pathway PDP required throughout birds life for normal song production while the anterior forebrain pathway AFP necessary for song learning juvenilles and plasticitymaintenance adults but not for adult song production Both neural pathways the song system begin the level HVC which projects information both the premotor nucleus and Area the anterior forebrain Information the posterior descending pathway also referred the vocal production motor pathway descends from HVC and then from the tracheosyringeal part the hypoglossal nerve nXIIts which then controls muscular contractions the syrinx Information the anterior forebrain pathway projected from HVC Area basal ganglia then from Area the DLM thalamus and from DLM LMAN which then links the vocal learning and vocal production pathways through connections back the Some investigators have posited model which the connection between LMAN and carries instructive signal based evaluation auditory feedback comparing the birds own song the memorized song template which adaptively alters the motor program for song output The generation this instructive signal could facilitated auditory neurons Area and LMAN that show selectivity for the temporal qualities the birds own song BOS and its tutor song providing platform for comparing the BOS and the memorized tutor song Models regarding the realtime errorcorrection interactions between the AFP and PDP will considered the future Other current research has begun explore the cellular mechanisms underlying HVC control temporal patterns song structure and control syllable productionBrain structures involved both pathways show sexual dimorphism many bird species usually causing males and females sing differently Some the known types dimorphisms the brain include the size nuclei the number neurons present and the number neurons connecting one nucleus another the extremely dimorphic zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata species which only males typically sing the size the HVC and are approximately three six times larger males than females and Area does not appear recognizable females Research suggests that exposure sex steroids during early development partially responsible for these differences the brain Female zebra finches treated with estradiol after hatching followed testosterone dihydrotestosterone DHT treatment adulthood will develop and HVC similar size males and will also display malelike singing behavior Hormone treatment alone does not seem produce female finches with brain structures behavior exactly like males Furthermore other research has shown results that contradict what would expected based our current knowledge mammalian sexual differentiation For example male zebra finches castrated given sex steroid inhibitors hatchlings still develop normal masculine singing behavior This suggests that other factors such the activation genes the chromosome might also play role normal male song development Hormones also have activational effects singing and the song nuclei adult birds canaries Serinus canaria females normally sing less often and with less complexity than males However when adult females are given androgen injections their singing will increase almost malelike frequency Furthermore adult females injected with androgens also show increased size the HVC and regions Melatonin another hormone that also believed influence song behavior adults many songbirds show melatonin receptors neurons the song nuclei Both the European starling Sturnus vulgaris and house sparrow Passer domesticus have demonstrated changes song nuclei correlated with differing exposures darkness and secretions melatonin This suggests that melatonin might play role the seasonal changes singing behavior songbirds that live areas where the amount daylight varies significantly throughout the year Several other studies have looked seasonal changes the morphology brain structures within the song system and have found that these changes adult neurogenesis gene expression are dictated photoperiod hormonal changes and behavior The gene FOXP2 defects which affect both speech production and comprehension language humans becomes highly expressed Area during periods vocal plasticity both juvenile zebra finches and adult canaries Early experiments Thorpe 1954 showed the importance bird being able hear tutors song When birds are raised isolation away from the influence conspecific males they still sing While the song they produce called isolate song resembles the song wild bird shows distinctly different characteristics from the wild song and lacks its complexity The importance the bird being able hear itself sing the sensorimotor period was later discovered Konishi Birds deafened before the songcrystallization period went produce songs that were distinctly different from the wild type and isolate song Since the emergence these findings investigators have been searching for the neural pathways that facilitate sensorysensorimotor learning and mediating the matching the birds own song with the memorized song template Several studies over recent decades have looked the neural mechanisms underlying birdsong learning performing lesions relevant brain structures involved the production maintenance song deafening birds before andor after song crystallization Another recent experimental approach was recording the birds song and then playing back while the bird singing causing perturbed auditory feedback the bird hears the superposition its own song and fragmented portion previous song syllable After Nordeen Nordeen made landmark discovery they demonstrated that auditory feedback was necessary for the maintenance song adult birds with crystallized song Leonardo Konishi 1999 designed auditory feedback perturbation protocol order explore the role auditory feedback adult song maintenance further investigate how adult songs deteriorate after extended exposure perturbed auditory feedback and examine the degree which adult birds could recover crystallized song over time after being removed from perturbed feedback exposure This study offered further support for role auditory feedback maintaining adult song stability and demonstrated how adult maintenance crystallized birdsong dynamic rather than static Brainard Doupe 2000 posit model which LMAN the anterior forebrain plays primary role error correction detects differences between the song produced the bird and its memorized song template and then sends instructive error signal structures the vocal production pathway order correct modify the motor program for song production their study Brainard Doupe 2000 showed that while deafening adult birds led the loss song stereotypy due altered auditory feedback and nonadaptive modification the motor program lesioning LMAN the anterior forebrain pathway adult birds that had been deafened led the stabilization song LMAN lesions deafened birds prevented any further deterioration syllable production and song structure Currently there are two competing models that elucidate the role LMAN generating instructive error signal and projecting the motor production pathway Leonardo tested these models directly recording spike rates single LMAN neurons adult zebra finches during singing conditions with normal and perturbed auditory feedback His results did not support the BOStuned error correction model the firing rates LMAN neurons were unaffected changes auditory feedback and therefore the error signal generated LMAN appeared unrelated auditory feedback Moreover the results from this study supported the predictions the efference copy model which LMAN neurons are activated during singing the efference copy the motor signal and its predictions expected auditory feedback allowing the neurons more precisely timelocked changes auditory feedback mirror neuron neuron that discharges both when individual performs action and when heshe perceives that same action being performed another These neurons were first discovered macaque monkeys but recent research suggests that mirror neuron systems may present other animals including humans Mirror neurons have the following characteristics Because mirror neurons exhibit both sensory and motor activity some researchers have suggested that mirror neurons may serve map sensory experience onto motor structures This has implications for birdsong learning many birds rely auditory feedback acquire and maintain their songs Mirror neurons may mediating this comparison what the bird hears how compares memorized song template and what produces search these auditorymotor neurons Jonathan Prather and other researchers Duke University recorded the activity single neurons the HVCs swamp sparrows They discovered that the neurons that project from the HVC Area HVCX neurons are highly responsive when the bird hearing playback his own song These neurons also fire similar patterns when the bird singing that same song Swamp sparrows employ different song types and the neural activity differs depending which song heard sung The HVCX neurons only fire response the presentation singing one the songs the primary song type They are also temporally selective firing precise phase the song syllable Prather found that during the short period time before and after the bird sings his HVCX neurons become insensitive auditory input other words the bird becomes deaf his own song This suggests that these neurons are producing corollary discharge which would allow for direct comparison motor output and auditory input This may the mechanism underlying learning via auditory feedback These findings are also line with Leonardos 2004 efference copy model error correction birdsong learning and production Overall the HVCX auditory motor neurons swamp sparrows are very similar the visual motor mirror neurons discovered primates Like mirror neurons the HVCX neurons The function the mirror neuron system still unclear Some scientists speculate that mirror neurons may play role understanding the actions others imitation theory mind and language acquisition though there currently insufficient neurophysiological evidence support these theories Specifically regarding birds possible that the mirror neuron system serves general mechanism underlying vocal learning but further research needed addition the implications for song learning the mirror neuron system could also play role territorial behaviors such songtype matching and countersinging The specificity bird calls has been used extensively for species identification The calls birds have been described using words nonsense syllables line diagrams Common terms English include words such quack chirp and chirrup These are subject imagination and vary greatly wellknown example the whitethroated sparrows song given Canada sweet Canada Canada Canada and New England Old Sam Peabody Peabody Peabody also Where are you Frederick Frederick Frederick addition nonsense words grammatically correct phrases have been constructed likenesses the vocalizations birds For example the barred owl produces motif which some bird guides describe Who cooks for you Who cooks for you all with the emphasis placed you Kay Electric Company started former Bell Labs engineers Harry Foster and Elmo Crump made device that was marketed the SonaGraph 1948 This was adopted early researchers including CEGBailey who demonstrated its use for studying bird song 1950 The use spectrograms visualize bird song was then adopted Donald Borror and developed further others including Thorpe These visual representations are also called sonograms sonagrams Beginning 1983 some field guides for birds use sonograms document the calls and songs birds The sonogram objective unlike descriptive phrases but proper interpretation requires experience Sonograms can also roughly converted back into sound Bird song integral part bird courtship and prezygotic isolation mechanism involved the process speciation Many allopatric subspecies show differences calls These differences are sometimes minute often detectable only the sonograms Song differences addition other taxonomic attributes have been used the identification new species The use calls has led proposals for splitting species complexes such those the Mirafra bushlarks Smartphone apps such Bird Song USA and Merlin Bird enable automatic recognition birds using sounds Like Shazam those apps work comparing spectrographic database for matches The language the birds has long been topic for anecdote and speculation That calls have meanings that are interpreted their listeners has been well demonstrated Domestic chickens have distinctive alarm calls for aerial and ground predators and they respond these alarm calls appropriately However language has addition words grammar that structures and rules Studies demonstrate the existence language have been difficult due the range possible interpretations For instance some have argued that order for communication system count language must combinatorial having open ended set grammarcompliant sentences made from finite vocabulary Research parrots Irene Pepperberg claimed demonstrate the innate ability for grammatical structures including the existence concepts such nouns adjectives and verbs the wild Blackcapped Chickadees innate vocalizations have been rigorously shown have combinatorial language Studies starling vocalizations have also suggested that they may have recursive structures The term bird language may also more informally refer patterns bird vocalizations that communicate information other birds other animals general The first known recording birdsong was made 1889 Ludwig Koch who went become eminent wildlife recordist and BBC natural history presenter Other notable birdsong recordists include Eric Simms Chris Watson and France JeanClaude Roch Franois Charron Fernand Deroussen music birdsong has influenced composers and musicians several ways they can inspired birdsong they can intentionally imitate bird song composition Vivaldi and Beethoven did along with many later composers they can incorporate recordings birds into their works Ottorino Respighi first did like Beatrice Harrison and David Rothenberg they can duet with birds Authors including Rothenberg have claimed that birds sing traditional scales used human music but least one songbird does not choose notes this way Among birds which habitually borrow phrases sounds from other species the way they use variations rhythm relationships musical pitch and combinations notes can resemble music Hollis Taylors indepth analysis pied butcherbird vocalizations provides detailed rebuttal objections birdsong being judged music The similar motor constraints human and avian song may have driven these have similar song structures including archshaped and descending melodic contours musical phrases long notes the ends phrases and typically small differences pitch between adjacent notes least birds with strong song structure like the Eurasian treecreeper Certhia familiaris Bird song popular subject poetry Famous examples inspired bird song include the 1177 Persian poem The Conference the Birds which the birds the world assemble under the wisest bird the hoopoe decide who their king English poetry John Keatss 1819 Ode Nightingale and Percy Bysshe Shelleys 1820 Skylark are popular classics Ted Hughess 1970 collection poems about bird character Crow considered one his most important works Bird poems Gerard Manley Hopkins include Sea and Skylark
