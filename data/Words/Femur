The femur fimr femurs femora fmr thigh bone the proximal bone the hindlimb tetrapod vertebrates The head the femur articulates with the acetabulum the pelvic bone forming the hip joint while the distal part the femur articulates with the tibia and kneecap forming the knee joint most measures the femur the strongest bone the body The femur also the longest bone the human body The femur the only bone the upper leg The two femurs converge medially toward the knees where they articulate with the proximal ends the tibiae The angle convergence the femora major factor determining the femoraltibial angle Human females have wider pelvic bones causing their femora converge more than males the condition genu valgum knock knee the femurs converge much that the knees touch one another The opposite extreme genu varum bowleggedness the general population people without either genu valgum genu varum the femoraltibial angle about 175 degrees The femur the longest and most measures the strongest bone the human body Its length average 2674 persons height ratio found both men and women and most ethnic groups with only restricted variation and useful anthropology because offers basis for reasonable estimate subjects height from incomplete skeleton The femur categorised long bone and comprises diaphysis shaft body and two epiphyses extremities that articulate with adjacent bones the hip and knee The upper proximal extremity close the torso contains the head neck the two trochanters and adjacent structures The head the femur which articulates with the acetabulum the pelvic bone comprises twothirds sphere has small groove fovea connected through the round ligament the sides the acetabular notch The head the femur connected the shaft through the neck collum The neck 45cm long and the diameter smallest front back and compressed its middle The collum forms angle with the shaft about 130 degrees This angle highly variant the infant about 150 degrees and old age reduced 120 degrees average abnormal increase the angle known coxa valga and abnormal reduction called coxa vara Both the head and neck the femur vastly embedded the hip musculature and can not directly palpated skinny people with the thigh laterally rotated the head the femur can felt deep resistance profound deep for the femoral artery The transition area between the head and neck quite rough due attachment muscles and the hip joint capsule Here the two trochanters greater and lesser trochanter are found The greater trochanter almost boxshaped and the most lateral prominent the femur The highest point the greater trochanter located higher than the collum and reaches the midpoint the hip joint The greater trochanter can easily felt The trochanteric fossa deep depression bounded posteriorly the intertrochanteric crest medial surface the greater trochanterThe lesser trochanter coneshaped extension the lowest part the femur neck The two trochanters are joined the intertrochanteric crest the back side and the intertrochanteric line the front slight ridge sometimes seen commencing about the middle the intertrochanteric crest and reaching vertically downward for about 5cm along the back part the body called the linea quadrata quadrate line About the junction the upper onethird and lower twothirds the intertrochanteric crest the quadrate tubercle located The size the tubercle varies and not always located the intertrochanteric crest and that also adjacent areas can part the quadrate tubercle such the posterior surface the greater trochanter the neck the femur small anatomical study was shown that the epiphyseal line passes directly through the quadrate tubercle The body the femur shaft long slender and almost cylindrical form little broader above than the center broadest and somewhat flattened from before backward below slightly arched convex front and concave behind where strengthened prominent longitudinal ridge the linea aspera which diverges proximal and distal the medial and lateral ridge Proximal the lateral ridge the linea aspera becomes the gluteal tuberosity while the medial ridge continues the pectineal line Besides the linea aspera the shaft has two other bordes lateral and medial border These three bordes separates the shaft into three surfaces One anterior one medial and one lateral Due the vast musculature the thigh the shaft can not palpated The third trochanter bony projection occasionally present the proximal femur near the superior border the gluteal tuberosity When present oblong rounded conical shape and sometimes continuous with the gluteal ridge structure minor importance humans the incidence the third trochanter varies from 1772 between ethnic groups and frequently reported more common females than males The lower extremity the femur distal extremity larger than the upper extremity somewhat cuboid form but its transverse diameter greater than its anteroposterior front back consists two oblong eminences known the condyles Anteriorly the condyles are slightly prominent and are separated smooth shallow articular depression called the patellar surface Posteriorly they project considerably and deep notch the Intercondylar fossa femur present between them The lateral condyle the more prominent and the broader both its anteroposterior and transverse diameters The medial condyle the longer and when the femur held with its body perpendicular projects lower level When however the femur its natural oblique position the lower surfaces the two condyles lie practically the same horizontal plane The condyles are not quite parallel with one another the long axis the lateral almost directly anteroposterior but that the medial runs backward and medialward Their opposed surfaces are small rough and concave and form the walls the intercondyloid fossa This fossa limited above ridge the intercondyloid line and below the central part the posterior margin the patellar surface The posterior cruciate ligament the knee joint attached the lower and front part the medial wall the fossa and the anterior cruciate ligament impression the upper and back part its lateral wall The articular surface the lower end the femur occupies the anterior inferior and posterior surfaces the condyles Its front part named the patellar surface and articulates with the patella presents median groove which extends downward the intercondyloid fossa and two convexities the lateral which broader more prominent and extends farther upward than the medial Each condyle surmounted elevation the epicondyle The medial epicondyle large convex eminence which the tibial collateral ligament the kneejoint attached its upper part the adductor tubercle and behind rough impression which gives origin the medial head the gastrocnemius The lateral epicondyle which smaller and less prominent than the medial gives attachment the fibular collateral ligament the kneejoint The femur develops from the limb buds result interactions between the ectoderm and the underlying mesoderm formation occurs roughly around the fourth week development the sixth week development the first hyaline cartilage model the femur formed chondrocytes Endochondral ossification begins the end the embryonic period and primary ossification centers are present all long bones the limbs including the femur the 12th week development The hindlimb development lags behind forelimb development days the femur the only bone the thigh serves attachment point for all the muscles that exert their force over the hip and knee joints Some biarticular muscles which cross two joints like the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles also originate from the femur all individual muscles either originate from insert onto the femur crosssection the thigh divided into three separate fascial compartments divided fascia each containing muscles These compartments use the femur axis and are separated tough connective tissue membranes septa Each these compartments has its own blood and nerve supply and contains different group muscles These compartments are named the anterior medial and posterior fascial compartments femoral fracture that involves the femoral head femoral neck the shaft the femur immediately below the lesser trochanter may classified hip fracture especially when associated with osteoporosis Femur fractures can managed prehospital setting with the use traction splint primitive tetrapods the main points muscle attachment along the femur are the internal trochanter and third trochanter and ridge along the ventral surface the femoral shaft referred the adductor crest The neck the femur generally minimal absent the most primitive forms reflecting simple attachment the acetabulum The greater trochanter was present the extinct archosaurs well modern birds and mammals being associated with the loss the primitive sprawling gait The lesser trochanter unique development mammals which lack both the internal and fourth trochanters The adductor crest also often absent mammals alternatively reduced series creases along the surface the bone Some species whales snakes and other nonwalking vertebrates have vestigial femurs One the earliest known vertebrates have femur the eusthenopteron prehistoric lobefinned fish from the Late Devonian period Structures analogous the third trochanter are present mammals including some primates invertebrate zoology the name femur appears arthropodology The usage not homologous with that vertebrate anatomy the term femur simply has been adopted analogy and refers where applicable the most proximal usually the two longest jointed segments the legs the arthropoda The two basal segments preceding the femur are the coxa and trochanter This convention not followed carcinology but applies arachnology and entomology myriapodology another segment the prefemur connects the trochanter and femur Position femur shown red Pelvis and patella are
