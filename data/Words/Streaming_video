Streaming media multimedia that constantly received and presented enduser while being delivered provider The verb stream refers the process delivering obtaining media this mannerclarification needed the term refers the delivery method the medium rather than the medium itself and alternative file downloading process which the enduser obtains the entire file for the content before watching listening client enduser can use their media player start playing the digital video content listens digital audio content before the entire file has been transmitted Distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically telecommunications networks most the delivery systems are either inherently streaming radio television streaming apps inherently nonstreaming books video cassettes audio CDs For example the 1930s elevator music was among the earliest popularly available streaming media nowadays Internet television common form streamed media The term streaming media can apply media other than video and audio such live closed captioning ticker tape and realtime text which are all considered streaming text Live streaming the delivery Internet content realtime events happen much live television broadcasts its contents over the airwaves via television signal Live internet streaming requires form source media video camera audio interface screen capture software encoder digitize the content media publisher and content delivery network distribute and deliver the content Live streaming does not need recorded the origination point although frequently There are challenges with streaming content the Internet the user does not have enough bandwidth their Internet connection they may experience stops lags slow buffering the content and some users may not able stream certain content due not having compatible computer software systems Some popular streaming services include the video sharing website YouTube Twitch and Mixer which live stream the playing video games Netflix and Amazon Video which stream movies and shows and Spotify Apple Music and TIDAL which stream music the early 1920s George Squier was granted patents for system for the transmission and distribution signals over electrical lines which was the technical basis for what later became Muzak technology streaming continuous music commercial customers without the use radio Attempts display media computers date back the earliest days computing the mid20thcentury However little progress was made for several decades primarily due the high cost and limited capabilities computer hardware From the late 1980s through the 1990s consumergrade personal computers became powerful enough display various media The primary technical issues related streaming were having enough CPU power and bus bandwidth support the required data rates and creating lowlatency interrupt paths the operating system prevent buffer underrun and thus enable skipfree streaming the content However computer networks were still limited the mid1990s and audio and video media were usually delivered over nonstreaming channels such downloading digital file from remote server and then saving local drive the end users computer storing digital file and playing back from CDROMs 1991 the first commercial Ethernet Switch see Network Switch was introduced which enabled more powerful computer networks leading the first streaming video solutions see Business developments below used schools and corporations such expanding Bloomberg Television worldwide the mid 1990s the World Wide Web was born but only could only support streaming audio until years later During the late 1990s and early 2000s users had increased access computer networks especially the Internet and especially during the early 2000s users had access increased network bandwidth especially the last mile These technological improvements facilitated the streaming audio and video content computer users their homes and workplaces well there was increasing use standard protocols and formats such TCPIP HTTP HTML and the Internet became increasingly commercialized which led infusion investment into the sector The band Severe Tire Damage was the first group perform live the Internet June241993 the band was playing gig XeroxPARC while elsewhere the building scientists were discussing new technology the Mbone for broadcasting the Internet using multicasting proof PARCs technology the bands performance was broadcast and could seen live Australia and elsewhere March 2017 interview band member Russ Haines stated that the band had used approximately half the total bandwidth the internet stream the performance which was 152by76 pixel video updated eight twelve times per second with audio quality that was best bad telephone connection Microsoft Research developed Microsoft application which was compiled under Windows Studio Suite and tested conjunction with Connectix QuickCam RealNetworks was also pioneer the streaming media markets when broadcast baseball game between the New York Yankees and the Seattle Mariners over the Internet 1995 The first symphonic concert the Internet took place the Paramount Theater Seattle Washington November101995 The concert was collaboration between The Seattle Symphony and various guest musicians such Slash GunsnRoses Velvet Revolver Matt Cameron Soundgarden Pearl Jam and Barrett Martin Screaming Trees When Word Magazine launched 1995 they featured the firstever streaming soundtracks the Internetcitation needed Metropolitan Opera Live program which the Metropolitan Opera streams opera performance live the performance taking place 20132014 operas were transmitted via satellite into least 2000 theaters countries The term streaming was first used for tape drives made Data Electronics Inc for drives meant slowly ramp and run for the entire track the slow ramp times resulted lower drive costs making more competitive product Streaming was applied the early 1990s better description for video demand and later live video networks first Starlight Networks for video streaming and Real Networks for audio streaming the time such video was usually referred store and forward video which was misleading nomenclature The first commercial streaming product appeared late 1992 and was named StarWorks and enabled demand MPEG1 full motion videos randomly accessed corporate Ethernet networks Starworks was from Starlight Networks who also pioneered live video streaming Ethernet and via Internet Protocol over satellites with Hughes Network Systems Other early companies who created streaming media technology include RealNetworks then known Progressive Networks and Protocomm both prior wide spread World Wide Web usage and once the web became popular the late 90s streaming video the internet blossomed from startups such VDOnet acquired RealNetworks and Precept acquired Cisco Microsoft developed media player known ActiveMovie 1995 that allowed streaming media and included proprietary streaming format which was the precursor the streaming feature later Windows Media Player64 1999 June1999 Apple also introduced streaming media format its QuickTime4 application was later also widely adopted websites along with RealPlayer and Windows Media streaming formats The competing formats websites required each user download the respective applications for streaming and resulted many users having have all three applications their computer for general compatibility 2000 Industryviewcom launched its worlds largest streaming video archive website help businesses promote themselves Webcasting became emerging tool for business marketing and advertising that combined the immersive nature television with the interactivity the Web The ability collect data and feedback from potential customers caused this technology gain momentum quickly Around 2002 the interest single unified streaming format and the widespread adoption Adobe Flash prompted the development video streaming format through Flash which was the format used Flashbased players many popular video hosting sites such YouTube now defaulting HTML5 video Increasing consumer demand for live streaming has prompted YouTube implement new live streaming service users Presently the company also offers secured link returning the available connection speed the user The Recording Industry Association America RIAA revealed through its 2015 earnings report that streaming services were responsible for 343 percent the years total music industrys revenue growing percent from the previous year and becoming the largest source income pulling around billion streaming revenue grew percent billion the first half 2016 and accounted for almost half industry sales These advances computer networking combined with powerful home computers and modern operating systems made streaming media practical and affordable for ordinary consumers Standalone Internet radio devices emerged offer listeners nocomputer option for listening audio streams These audio streaming services have become increasingly popular over recent years streaming music hit record 1181 billion streams 2013 general multimedia content has large volume media storage and transmission costs are still significant offset this somewhat media are generally compressed for both storage and streaming Increasing consumer demand for streaming high definition content has led the industry develop number technologies such WirelessHD ITUTGhn which are optimized for streaming content without forcing the user install new networking cables 1996 digital pioneer Marc Scarpa produced the first largescale online live broadcast history the Adam Yauchled Tibetan Freedom Concert event that would define the format social change broadcasts Scarpa continued pioneer the streaming media world with projects such Woodstock Townhall with President Clinton and more recently Covered CAs campaign Tell Friend Get Covered which was live streamed YouTube Robert Christgau 2018 2016 media stream can streamed either live demand Live streams are generally provided means called true streaming True streaming sends the information straight the computer device without saving the file hard disk Ondemand streaming provided means called progressive streaming progressive download Progressive streaming saves the file hard disk and then played from that location Ondemand streams are often saved hard disks and servers for extended amounts time while the live streams are only available one time only egduring the football game Streaming media increasingly being coupled with use social media For example sites such YouTube encourage social interaction webcasts through features such live chat online surveys user posting comments online and more Furthermore streaming media increasingly being used for social business and elearning Due the popularity the streaming medias many developers have introduced free movie streaming apps for the people who use smaller devices such tablets and smartphones for everyday purposes The Horowitz Research State Pay OTT and SVOD 2017 report said that percent those viewing content did through streaming service and that percent viewing was done this way twice the number from five years earlier Millennials the report said streamed percent content One the movie streaming industrys largest impacts was the DVD industry which effectively met its demise with the mass popularization online content The rise media streaming caused the downfall many DVD rental companies such Blockbuster July 2015 the New York Times published article about Netflixs DVD services stated that Netflix was continuing their DVD services with million subscribers which was significant drop from the previous year the other hand their streaming services had million members March 2016 study assessing the Impact Movie Streaming over traditional DVD Movie Rental was found that respondents did not purchase DVD movies nearly much anymore all streaming had taken over the market According the study viewers did not find movie quality significantly different between DVD and online streaming Issues that respondents believed needed improvement with movie streaming included functions fast forwarding rewinding well search functions The article highlighted that the quality movie streaming industry would only increase time advertising revenue continued soar yearly basis throughout the industry providing incentive for quality content production broadband speed Mbits more recommended for streaming standard definition video without experiencing buffering skips especially live video for example Roku AppleTV GoogleTV SonyTV Bluray Disc Player 5Mbits recommended for High Definition content and 9Mbits for UltraHigh Definition content Streaming media storage size calculated from the streaming bandwidth and length the media using the following formula for single user and file requires storage size megabytes which equal length seconds bit rate bits 1024 1024 For example one hour digital video encoded 300 kbits this was typical broadband video 2005 and was usually encoded 320 240 pixels window size will be3600 300000 bits 810241024 requires around 128 storage the file stored server for ondemand streaming and this stream viewed 1000people the same time using Unicast protocol the requirement 300 kbits 1000 300000 kbits 300 Mbits bandwidth This equivalent around 135GB per hour Using multicast protocol the server sends out only single stream that common all users Therefore such stream would only use 300kbits serving bandwidth See below for more information these protocols The calculation for live streaming similar Assuming that the seed the encoder 500 kbits and the show lasts for hours with 3000 viewers then the calculation number MBs transferred encoder speed bits number seconds number viewers 810241024 The results this calculation are follows number MBs transferred 500 1024 bits 3600 hours 3000 number viewers 810241024 1977539 The audio stream compressed make the file size smaller using audio coding format such MP3 Vorbis AAC Opus The video stream compressed using video coding format make the file size smaller Video coding formats include H264 HEVC VP8 VP9 Encoded audio and video streams are assembled container bitstream such MP4 FLV WebM ASF ISMA The bitstream delivered from streaming server streaming client the computer user with their Internetconnected laptop using transport protocol such Adobes RTMP RTP the 2010s technologies such Apples HLS Microsofts Smooth Streaming Adobes HDS and nonproprietary formats such MPEGDASH have emerged enable adaptive bitrate streaming over HTTP alternative using proprietary transport protocols Often streaming transport protocol used send video from event venue cloud transcoding service and CDN which then uses HTTPbased transport protocols distribute the video individual homes and users The streaming client the end user may interact with the streaming server using control protocol such MMS RTSP Designing network protocol support streaming media raises many problems Datagram protocols such the User Datagram Protocol UDP send the media stream series small packets This simple and efficient however there mechanism within the protocol guarantee delivery the receiving application detect loss corruption and recover data using error correction techniques data lost the stream may suffer dropout The Realtime Streaming Protocol RTSP Realtime Transport Protocol RTP and the Realtime Transport Control Protocol RTCP were specifically designed stream media over networks RTSP runs over variety transport protocols while the latter two are built top UDP Another approach that seems incorporate both the advantages using standard web protocol and the ability used for streaming even live content adaptive bitrate streaming HTTP adaptive bitrate streaming based HTTP progressive download but contrary the previous approach here the files are very small that they can compared the streaming packets much like the case using RTSP and RTP Reliable protocols such the Transmission Control Protocol TCP guarantee correct delivery each bit the media stream However they accomplish this with system timeouts and retries which makes them more complex implement also means that when there data loss the network the media stream stalls while the protocol handlers detect the loss and retransmit the missing data Clients can minimize this effect buffering data for display While delay due buffering acceptable video demand scenarios users interactive applications such video conferencing will experience loss fidelity the delay caused buffering exceeds 200ms Unicast protocols send separate copy the media stream from the server each recipient Unicast the norm for most Internet connections but does not scale well when many users want view the same television program concurrently Multicast protocols were developed reduce the servernetwork loads resulting from duplicate data streams that occur when many recipients receive unicast content streams independently These protocols send single stream from the source group recipients Depending the network infrastructure and type multicast transmission may may not feasible One potential disadvantage multicasting the loss video demand functionality Continuous streaming radio television material usually precludes the recipients ability control playback However this problem can mitigated elements such caching servers digital settop boxes and buffered media players Multicast provides means send single media stream group recipients computer network multicast protocol usually Internet Group Management Protocol used manage delivery multicast streams the groups recipients LAN One the challenges deploying multicast that routers and firewalls between LANs must allow the passage packets destined multicast groups the organization that serving the content has control over the network between server and recipients ieeducational government and corporate intranets then routing protocols such Protocol Independent Multicast can used deliver stream content multiple Local Area Network segments mass delivery content multicast protocols need much less energy and other resources widespread introduction reliable multicast broadcastlike protocols and their preferential use wherever possible significant ecological and economic challengecitation needed Peertopeer P2P protocols arrange for prerecorded streams sent between computers This prevents the server and its network connections from becoming bottleneck However raises technical performance security quality and business issues Useful and typical applications the streaming concept are for example long video lectures performed online the Internet advantage this presentation that these lectures can very long indeed although they can always interrupted repeated arbitrary places There are also new marketing concepts For example the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra sells Internet live streams whole concerts instead several CDs similar fixed media their socalled Digital Concert Hall using YouTube for trailing purposes only These online concerts are also spread over lot different places cinemas various places the globe similar concept used the Metropolitan Opera New York Many successful startup ventures have based their business streaming media There also livestream from the International Space Station Media that live streamed can recorded through certain media players such VLC player through the use Screen Recorder Livestreaming platforms such Twitch may also incorporate video demand system that allows automatic recording live broadcasts that they can watched later Streaming copyrighted content can involve making infringing copies the works question Streaming looking content the Internet legal Europe even that material
