Gudamakari and Lechkhumi separate dialects and some consider Kartli and Kakheti separate dialects Two more regions Saingilo the territory Azerbaijan and Lazeti the territory Turkey are sometimes also included the characteristics Georgian traditional music Georgian folk music predominantly vocal and widely known for its rich traditions vocal polyphony widely accepted contemporary musicology that polyphony Georgian music predates the introduction Christianity Georgia beginning the 4th century All regional styles Georgian music have traditions vocal cappella polyphony although the most southern regions Meskheti and Lazeti only historical sources provide the information about the presence vocal polyphony before the 20th century Vocal polyphony based ostinato formulas and rhythmic drone are widely distributed all Georgian regional styles Apart from these common techniques there are also other more complex forms polyphony pedal drone polyphony Eastern Georgia particularly Kartli and Kakheti table songs two highly embellished melodic lines develop rhythmically free the background pedal drone and contrapuntal polyphony Achara Imereti Samegrelo and particularly Guria three and four part polyphony with highly individualized melodic lines each part and the use several polyphonic techniques Western Georgian contrapuntal polyphony features the local variety the yodel known krimanchuli Both east and west Georgian polyphony based wide use sharp dissonant harmonies seconds fourths sevenths ninths Because the wide use the specific chord consisting the fourth and second top the fourth CFG the founder Georgian ethnomusicology Dimitri Arakishvili called this chord the Georgian Triad Georgian music also known for colorful modulations and unusual key changes Georgian polyphonic singing was among the first the list Masterpieces the Oral and Intangible Heritage Humanity 2001 Georgian polyphonic singing was relisted the Representative List the Intangible Cultural Heritage Humanity 2008 was inscribed the Intangible Cultural Heritage Georgia registry 2011 There are different sometimes conflicting views the nature Georgian scales The most prevalent the view expressed Vladimer Gogotishvili who suggested distinguishing diatonic scales based system perfect fourths and those based system perfect fifths system based perfect fourths mostly present Eastern Georgia but scales based perfect fifths are spread wider both eastern and particularly western Georgia well Georgian Christian chants East Georgian table songs the scale system based combination the systems fourth and fifth diatonic scales such songs the principle the fourth diatonic scale working above the pedal drone and the system the fifth diatonic working under the pedal drone Because the peculiarity the scale system based perfect fifths there often augmented octave Georgian songs and churchsongs many traditional musical systems tuning Georgian scales not based the Western classical equally tempered 12tone tuning system The fifth usually perfect but the second third and fourth are different from Classical intervals producing slightly compressed compared most European music major second neutral third and slightly stretched fourth Likewise between the fifth and the octave come two evenly spaced notes producing slightly compressed major sixth and stretched minor seventh Because the strong influence Western European music presentday performers Georgian folk music often employ Western tuning bringing the seconds fourths sixths and sevenths and sometimes the thirds well closer the standard equally tempered scale This process started from the very first professional choir organized Georgia 1886 called Agniahsvili choro From the 1980s some ensembles most notably the Georgian ensembles Mtiebi and Anchiskhati and the American ensemble Kavkasia have tried reintroduce the original nontempered traditional tuning system some regions most notably Svaneti some traditional singers still sing the old nontempered tuning system Singing mostly community activity Georgia and during big celebrations for example weddings all the community expected participate singing Traditionally top melodic parts are performed individual singers but the bass can have dozens even hundreds singers There are also songs usually more complex that require very small number performers Out them the tradition trio three singers only very popular western Georgia particularly Guria Georgian folk songs are often centered around banquetlike feasts called supra where songs and toasts God peace motherland long life love friendship and other topics are proposed Traditional feast songs include Zamtari Winter which about the transient nature life and sung commemorate ancestors and great number
