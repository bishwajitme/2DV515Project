The Groe Fuge Grosse Fuge also known English Great Fugue Grand Fugue 133 singlemovement composition for string quartet Ludwig van Beethoven immense double fugue was universally condemned contemporary critics reviewer writing for Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung 1826 described the fugue incomprehensible like Chinese and confusion Babel However critical opinion the work has risen steadily since the beginning the 20th century The work now considered among Beethovens greatest achievements Igor Stravinsky said absolutely contemporary piece music that will contemporary forever The Groe Fuge originally served the final movement his Quartet major 130 written 1825 But Beethovens publisher who was concerned about the dismal commercial prospects the piece urged Beethoven replace the fugue with new finale Beethoven complied and the Groe Fuge was published separately 1827 133 was composed when Beethoven was almost completely deaf and considered part his set late quartets was first performed 1826 the finale the quartet the Schuppanzigh Quartet Analysts describe the Groe Fuge inaccessible eccentric filled with paradoxes and Armaggedon stands out the most problematic single work Beethovens output and doubtless the entire literature music writes critic and musicologist Joseph Kerman the fugue Also writes violinist and composer David Matthews fiendishly difficult play Beethoven originally composed the Groe Fuge the final movement his String Quartet 130 His choice fugal form for the last movement was well grounded tradition Haydn Mozart and Beethoven himself had used fugues final movements quartets But recent years Beethoven had become increasingly concerned with the challenge integrating this Baroque form into the Classical structure student days made dozens fugues but imagination also wishes exert its privileges and new and really poetic element must introduced into the traditional form Beethoven wrote The resulting movement was mammoth work longer than all the other movements the quartet together Beethoven wrote the top the score Grande fugue tantt libre tantt recherche grand fugue somewhat free somewhat researched indication his ambition reconcile the academic and the romantic The fugue dedicated the Archduke Rudolf Austria his student and patron the first performance the quartet other movements were received enthusiastically but the fugue was not success review the performance the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung one Viennas leading music periodicals called the fugue incomprehensible like Chinese and confusion Babel Composer and violinist Louis Spohr called the fugue and the other late quartets indecipherable uncorrected horror Despite the contemporary criticism Beethoven himself never doubted the value the fugue Karl Holz Beethovens confidant and second violinist the Schuppanzigh quartet that performed the work brought Beethoven the news that the audience had demanded encores two middle movements Beethoven enraged was reported have growled And why didnt they encore the Fugue That alone should have been repeated Cattle Asses However the fugue was roundly condemned critics and audience alike that Beethovens publisher Matthias Artaria 17931835 decided try convince Beethoven publish separately Holz was given the task convincing Beethoven separate the fugue from the rest the quartet Holz wrote Artariacharged with the terrible and difficult task convincing Beethoven compose new finale which would more accessible the listeners well the instrumentalists substitute for the fugue which was difficult understand maintained Beethoven that this fugue which departed from the ordinary and surpassed even the last quartets originality should published separate work and that merited designation separate opus communicated him that Artaria was disposed pay him supplementary honorarium for the new finale Beethoven told would reflect but already the next day received letter giving his agreement Why the notoriously stubborn Beethoven agreed readily replace the fugue enigma the history this quintessentially enigmatic piece Historians have speculated that did for the money Beethoven was extremely bad managing his money and was often broke satisfy his critics because Beethoven simply came believe the fugue stood best its own The fugue connected the other movements opus 130 various hints motifs and tonal link the preceding Cavatina movement the Cavatina ends and the fugue begins with the same The replacement last movement the other hand which also begins relatively light character and completely uncontroversial Beethoven composed the replacement finale late 1826 the last substantial piece music was write May 1827 about two months after Beethovens death Matthias Artaria published the first edition 130 with the new finale and the Groe Fuge 133 well fourhand piano arrangement 134 Dozens analyses have attempted delve the structure the Groe Fuge with conflicting results The work has been described expansion the formal Baroque grand fugue multimovement work rolled into single piece symphonic poem sonata form Stephen Husarik has suggested that the relationships between the keys the different sections the fugue mirror what describes the wedgelike structure the eightnote motif that the main fugal subject the contour that driving force behind the Groe Fuge But writes Leah Gayle Weinberg The Groe Fuge has been and continues problematic subject scholarly discussion for many reasons the most basic that its very form defies categorization The central motif the fugue eightnote subject that climbs chromatically upward similar motif appears Act measures 4447 the Dance the Blessed Spirits from Glucks opera Orfeo Euridice 1774 and also Haydns String Quartet 2729 Another similar subject with syncopated gapped rhythm called unterbrechung German appears treatise counterpoint Johann Georg Albrechtsberger who taught Beethoven composition Joseph Kerman suggests that Beethoven modeled the motif after Bachs fugue minor from The WellTempered Clavier Its subject shown below Whatever the origin the motif Beethoven was fascinated used fragments number places the late quartets most notably the first movement his 132 string quartet The opening shown below the course the Groe Fuge Beethoven plays this motif every possible variation fortissimo and pianissimo different rhythms upside down and backwards The usual practice traditional fugue make simple unadorned statement the subject the outset but Beethoven from the very beginning presents the subject host variations stark contrast this simple chromatic motif the second subject the fugue which leaps dramatically huge intervals tenths and twelfths The third motif lilting melody that serves the theme the andante section the fugue fourth element not much motif effect the trill Beethoven also uses trills extensively simultaneously creating sense disintegration the motifs leading climax Beethoven opens the fugue with 24bar overture which opens with dramatic fortissimo unison and statement the main fugal subject the key major This statement the subject disintegrates into trill and silence Beethoven then repeats the subject but completely different rhythm diminution meaning double the tempo twice climbing the scale and then again silence and again the subject this time unadorned dramatic drop pianissimo the key major This leads statement the third fugal subject with the first subject the bass Thus Beethoven this brief introduction presents not only the material that will make the entire piece but also the spirit violent shifts mood melodies disintegrating into chaos dramatic silences instability and struggle Following the overture strictly formal double fugue the key major that follows all the rules Baroque fugue exposition and three variations showcasing different contrapuntal devices But this anything but tame Baroque fugue violent and dissonant pitting awkward leaps the second subject iambic rhythm against the main subject syncopation constant dynamic that never falls below forte The resulting angular rhythmic confusion and displaced dissonances last almost five minutes First Beethoven restates the main subject broken rests between each note Then begins double fugue two subjects played one against the other The second subject the first violin and the first subject syncopated the viola Then the second violin and cello take the same thing The first variation following the rules fugue opens the subdominant key Beethoven adds the chaos with triplet figure the first violin played against the quaternary rhythm the second subject the second violin and the syncopated main subject the viola The second variation back the key stretto section this Beethoven adds countersubject dactylic rhythm shown red below the third variation Beethoven presents variation the second subject the triplet rhythm the countersubject the first variation with the main subject syncopated eighth notes diminution that the subject played twice the speed This last variation grows increasingly chaotic with triplets breaking out the inner voices until ultimately collapses each instrument finishing different part the measure and ending inconclusively final fermata leading the next section the key This section complete change character from the formal fugue that preceded and the one that follows fugato section that combines contrapuntal writing with homophony After the strenuousness the Fugue first section the effect almost blinding innocence writes Joseph Kerman Analysts who see the fugue multimovement work rolled into one view this the traditional Andante movement opens with statement the third subject against pedal tone the viola and continues with the third subject the second violin against the main subject cantus firmus the viola The counterpoint becomes more complex with the cello and first violin playing the main subject canon while the second violin and viola pass the third subject between them Despite the growing complexity the fugal writing Beethoven instructs the players sempre piano always quiet Leonard Ratner writes this section This comes wonderful change color offered with the silkiest textures and with exquisite moments glowing diatonism The polyphony gradually dissipates into homophony and from there into unison finally tapering into dying measured sixteenthnote tremolo when the next section bursts the key Beethoven shifts gears from from from pianissimo fortissimo The fortissimo descends immediately piano for short interlude before the second fugue This interlude based the main subject diminution meaning double time top this Beethoven adds lilting slightly comic melody analysts who see the fugue multimovement work consider this section the equivalent scherzo this interlude Beethoven introduces the use trill hinted the end the Meno mosso section The music grows intensity and shifts into major for new learned fugue this fugue Beethoven puts together three versions the main subject the subject its simple form but augmentation meaning half the speed the same subject abbreviated retrograde that played backwards and variation the first half the subject diminution that double time Together they sound like this Here Beethoven starts use trills intensely This adds the extremely dense texture and rhythmic complexity Kerman writes this fugal section The piece seems danger cracking under the tension its own rhythmic fury the second episode this fugue Beethoven adds the triplet figure from the first variation the first fugue The trills become more intense the third episode the dominant key major Beethoven uses leaping motif that recalls the second subject the first fugue The fourth episode returns the key The cello plays the main subject way that harks back the overtura More elements the first fugue return the syncopation used for the main subject the tenth leaps from the second subject the diminuted main subject the viola This leads back restatement the meno mosso moderato section This time though instead silky pianissimo the fugato played forte heavily accented Beethoven writes every sixteenthnote group marchlike Analysts who see the fugue variation sonataallegro form consider this part the recapitulation section though the material does not return home key this section Beethoven uses another complex contrapuntal device the second violin plays the theme the first violin plays the main subject high register and the viola plays the main subject inversion that upside down series trills leads back the home key and restatement the scherzo section There follows section that analysts have described uneasy hesitation puzzling and diffused Fragments the various subjects appear and disappear and the music seems lose energy silence and then fragmentary burst the opening the first fugue Another silence snippet the meno mosso Another silence way this similar how the final movement the Ninth Symphony briefly quotes the first second and third movements turn And then fortissimo restatement the very opening the piece leading the coda From here the music moves forward first haltingly but then with more and more energy the final passage where the first subject played triplets below the soaring violin line playing variant the second subject Analyses the Groe Fuge help understand the structure and contrapuntal devices this mammoth piece But writes musicologist David Levy Regardless how one hears the piece structurally the composition remains filled with paradoxes that leave the listener ultimately dissatisfied with exegesis derived solely from structural perspective Since its composition musicians critics and listeners have tried explain the tremendous impact this piece has one the great artistic testaments the human capacity for meaning the face the threat chaos Abiding faith the relevance visionary struggle our lives powerfully informs the structure and character the music writes Mark Steinberg violinist the Brentano String Quartet More than anything else music justifies the ways God men writes musicologist Leonard Ratner But beyond recognition the hugeness and almost mystical impact the music critics fail agree its character Robert Kahn says presents titanic struggle overcome Daniel Chua the contrary writes The work speaks failure the very opposite the triumphant synthesis associated with Beethovenian recapitulationsfull citation needed Stephen Husarik his essay Musical direction and the wedge Beethovens high comedy Grosse Fuge 133 contends that the fugue Beethoven actually writing parody Baroque formalism The Fuga op133 stumbles forward what probably the most relentless and humorous assertion modal rhythms since 12th century Notre Dame organum Kahn disagrees the comparison comic music surprising There nothing comic about the Grosse Fuge many discussions the piece the issue struggle central Sara Bitloch violinist the Elias String Quartet says this sense struggle informs her groups interpretation the fugue Every part has feel like its huge struggle You need finish the Grosse Fuge absolutely exhausted She calls the piece apocalyptic Arnold Steinhardt the Guarneri String Quartet calls Armageddon the chaos out which life itself evolved One way express the impact the fugue through poetry her poem Little Fugue Sylvia Plath associates the fugue with death melange hazy associations with the Yew tree symbol death Celtic Britain the Holocaust and the death her own father could hear BeethovenBlack yew white cloudThe horrific complicationsFingertrapsa tumult keysEmpty and silly platesSo the blind smileI envy big noisesThe yew hedge the Grosse FugeDeafness something elseSuch dark funnel fatherI see your voiceBlack and leafy childhood The poet Mark Doty wrote his feelings listening the Groe Fuge What does mean chaosgathered into sudden bronze sweetnessan October flourish and then that momentdenied turned acid disassemblingquestioned rephrased After the first performance 1826 the fugue was not known have been performed public again until 1853 Paris the Maurin Quartet One hundred years after its publication still had not entered the standard quartet repertoire The attitude mind which most people listen chamber music must undergo radical change understand this piece wrote Joseph Marliave more than century after its publication this fugue one the two works Beethoventhe other being the fugue from the piano sonata 106which should excluded from performance late 1947 Daniel Gregory Mason called the fugue repellent the 1920s some quartets were including the fugue programs Since then the fugue has grown greatly the eyes musicians and performers The Great Fugue now seems the most perfect miracle music said Igor Stravinsky also the most absolutely contemporary piece music know and contemporary forever Hardly birthmarked its age the Great Fugue rhythm alone more subtle than any music own century love beyond everything Pianist Glenn Gould said for the Grosse Fuge not only the greatest work Beethoven ever wrote but just about the most astonishing piece musical literature Some analysts and musicians see the fugue first assault the diatonic tonal system that prevailed Classical music Robert Kahn sees the main subject the fugue precursor the tone row the basis the twelvetone system developed Arnold Schoenberg Your cradle was Beethovens Grosse Fuge artist Oskar Kokoschka wrote Schoenberg letter Composer Alfred Schnittke quotes the subject his third string quartet 1983 There have also been numerous orchestral arrangements the fugue including conductor Wilhelm Furtwngler and Felix Weingartner Performers approaching the Groe Fuge face host technical and musical challenges Among the technical difficulties the piece are difficult passagework complex crossrhythms that require exact synchronization and problems intonation where the harmonies pass from dissonance resolution Once mastering the technical difficulties there are many interpretive issues resolve The first these what context play the fugue the finale Opus 130 was originally written separate piece Playing the fugue the final movement Opus 130 rather than the light Haydnesque replacement movement completely changes the character the quartet note analysts Robert Winter and Robert Martin Played with the new finale the preceding movement the Cavatina heartfelt and intense aria the emotional center the piece Played with the fugue the finale the Cavatina prelude the massive and compelling fugue the other hand the fugue stands alone well Current taste decisively favor the fugal finale conclude Winter and Martin number quartets have recorded Opus 130 with the fugue and the replacement finale separate disks second issue facing performers whether choose learned interpretation one that clarifies the complex contrapuntal structure the piece one that focuses primarily the dramatic impulses the music Beethoven had taken form that basically intellectual form where the emotions take second place compared the structure and has completely turned that around writing one the most emotionally charged pieces ever says Sara Bitloch the Elias Quartet performer thats particularly difficult balance find Our first approach was find kind hierarchy the themes but found that when that were really missing the point the piece After deciding the overall approach the music there are numerous local decisions made about how play particular passages Perhaps the most notable these issues concerns the peculiar notation that Beethoven uses the syncopated presentation the main subject first the overtura but later throughout the piece Rather than writing this series quarter notes writes two tied eighth notes What did Beethoven mean this Many musicologists have tried explain this David Levy has written entire article the notation and Stephen Husarik looked the history Baroque ornamentation for explanation Performers have interpreted various ways The Alban Berg Quartett plays the notes almost single note but with emphasis the first eighth note create subtle differentiation Eugene Drucker the Emerson String Quartet plays this two distinct eighth notes Mark Steinberg the Brentano String Quartet sometimes joins the eighth notes and sometimes separates them marking the difference playing the first eighth without vibrato then adding vibrato for the second eighth note early 1826 the publisher the 130 String Quartet Mathias Artaria told Beethoven there were many requests for piano fourhand arrangement the Groe Fuge This was well before any discussion separating the fugue from the main body the quartet Artaria asked Beethoven prepare the arrangement but Beethoven was not interested Artaria instead asked Anton Halm prepare Beethoven was not satisfied with Halms work and subsequently made his own notefornote arrangement the quartet Beethovens arrangement was completed subsequent
