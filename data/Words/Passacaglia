The passacaglia pskli Italian musical form that originated early seventeenthcentury Spain and still used today composers usually serious character and often but not always based bassostinato and written triple metre The term passacaglia Spanish pasacalle French passacaille Italian passacaglia passacaglio passagallo passacagli passacaglie derives from the Spanish pasar walk and calle street originated early 17th century Spain strummed interlude between instrumentally accompanied dances songs Despite the forms Spanish roots confirmed references Spanish literature the period the first written examples passacaglias are found Italian source dated 1606 These pieces well others from Italian sources from the beginning the century are simple brief sequences chords outlining cadential formula The passacaglia was redefined the late 1620s Italian composer Girolamo Frescobaldi who transformed into series continuous variations over bass which itself may varied Later composers adopted this model and the nineteenth century the word came mean series variations over ostinato pattern usually serious character similar form the chaconne was also first developed Frescobaldi The two genres are closely related but since composers often used the terms chaconne and passacaglia indiscriminately modern attempts arrive clear distinction are arbitrary and historically unfounded early scholarship attempts formally differentiate between the historical chaconne and passacaglia were made but researchers often came opposite conclusions For example Percy Goetschius held that the chaconne usually based harmonic sequence with recurring soprano melody and the passacaglia was formed over ground bass pattern whereas Clarence Lucas defined the two forms precisely the opposite way More recently however some progress has been made toward making useful distinction for the usage the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries when some composers notably Frescobaldi and Franois Couperin deliberately mixed the two genres the same composition One the best known examples the passacaglia Western classical music the Passacaglia and Fugue minor BWV 582 for organ Johann Sebastian
