Music art form and cultural activity whose medium sound organized time general definitions music will include common elements such pitch which governs melody and harmony rhythm and its associated concepts tempo meter and articulation dynamics loudness and softness and the sonic qualities timbre and texture which are sometimes termed the color musical sound Different styles types music may emphasize deemphasize omit some these elements Music performed with vast range instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing rapping there are solely instrumental pieces solely vocal pieces such songs without instrumental accompaniment and pieces that combine singing and instruments The word derives from Greek mousike art the MusesSee glossary musical terminology its most general form the activities describing music art form cultural activity include the creation works music songs tunes symphonies and the criticism music the study the history music and the aesthetic examination music Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music tones ordered horizontally melodies and vertically harmonies Common sayings such the harmony the spheres and music ears point the notion that music often ordered and pleasant listen However 20thcentury composer John Cage thought that any sound can music saying for example There noise only sound The creation performance significance and even the definition music vary according culture and social context Indeed throughout history some new forms styles music have been criticized not being music including Beethovens Grosse Fuge string quartet 1825 early jazz the beginning the 1900s and hardcore punk the 1980s There are many types music including popular music traditional music art music music written for religious ceremonies and work songs such chanteys Music ranges from strictly organized compositionssuch Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s through spontaneously played improvisational music such jazz and avantgarde styles chancebased contemporary music from the 20th and 21st centuries Music can divided into genres country music and genres can further divided into subgenres country blues and pop country are two the many country subgenres although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle sometimes open personal interpretation and occasionally controversial For example can hard draw the line between some early 1980s hard rock and heavy metal Within the arts music may classified performing art fine art auditory art Music may played sung and heard live rock concert orchestra performance heard live part dramatic work music theater show opera may recorded and listened radio MP3 player player smartphone film score show many cultures music important part peoples way life plays key role religious rituals rite passage ceremonies graduation and marriage social activities dancing and cultural activities ranging from amateur karaoke singing playing amateur funk band singing community choir People may make music hobby like teen playing cello youth orchestra work professional musician singer The music industry includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces such songwriters and composers individuals who perform music which include orchestra jazz band and rock band musicians singers and conductors individuals who record music music producers and sound engineers individuals who organize concert tours and individuals who sell recordings sheet music and scores customers The word derives from Greek mousike art the Muses Greek mythology the nine Muses were the goddesses who inspired literature science and the arts and who were the source the knowledge embodied the poetry songlyrics and myths the Greek culture According the Online Etymological Dictionary the term music derived from mid13c musike from Old French musique 12c and directly from Latin musica the art music also including poetry also the source Spanish musica Italian musica Old High German mosica German Musik Dutch muziek Danish musik This derived from the Greek mousike techne art the Muses from fem mousikos pertaining the Muses from Mousa Muse see muse Modern spelling dates from the 1630s classical Greece the term music refers any art which the Muses presided but especially music and lyric poetry Music composed and performed for many purposes ranging from aesthetic pleasure religious ceremonial purposes entertainment product for the marketplace When music was only available through sheet music scores such during the Classical and Romantic eras music lovers would buy the sheet music their favourite pieces and songs that they could perform them home the piano With the advent sound recording records popular songs rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs With the advent home tape recorders the 1980s and digital music the 1990s music lovers could make tapes playlists their favourite songs and take them with them portable cassette player MP3 player Some music lovers create mix tapes their favorite songs which serve selfportrait gesture friendship prescription for ideal party and environment consisting solely what most ardently loved Amateur musicians can compose perform music for their own pleasure and derive their income elsewhere Professional musicians are employed range institutions and organisations including armed forces marching bands concert bands and popular music groups churches and synagogues symphony orchestras broadcasting film production companies and music schools Professional musicians sometimes work freelancers session musicians seeking contracts and engagements variety settings There are often many links between amateur and professional musicians Beginning amateur musicians take lessons with professional musicians community settings advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians variety ensembles such community concert bands and community orchestras distinction often made between music performed for live audience and music that performed studio that can recorded and distributed through the music retail system the broadcasting system However there are also many cases where live performance front audience also recorded and distributed Live concert recordings are popular both classical music and popular music forms such rock where illegally taped live concerts are prized music lovers the jam band scene live improvised jam sessions are preferred studio recordings Composition the act practice creating song instrumental music piece work with both singing and instruments another type music many cultures including Western classical music the act composing also includes the creation music notation such sheet music score which then performed the composer other singers musicians popular music and traditional music the act composing which typically called songwriting may involve the creation basic outline the song called the lead sheet which sets out the melody lyrics and chord progression classical music the composer typically orchestrates his her own compositions but musical theatre and pop music songwriters may hire arranger the orchestration some cases songwriter may not use notation all and instead compose the song her mind and then play record from memory jazz and popular music notable recordings influential performers are given the weight that written scores play classical music Even when music notated relatively precisely classical music there are many decisions that performer has make because notation does not specify all the elements music precisely The process deciding how perform music that has been previously composed and notated termed interpretation Different performers interpretations the same work music can vary widely terms the tempos that are chosen and the playing singing style phrasing the melodies Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs just much those who perform the music others The standard body choices and techniques present given time and given place referred performance practice whereas interpretation generally used mean the individual choices performercitation needed Although musical composition often uses musical notation and has single author this not always the case work music can have multiple composers which often occurs popular music when band collaborates write song musical theatre when one person writes the melodies second person writes the lyrics and third person orchestrates the songs some styles music such the blues composersongwriter may create perform and record new songs pieces without ever writing them down music notation piece music can also composed with words images computer programs that explain notate how the singer musician should create musical sounds Examples range from avantgarde music that uses graphic notation text compositions such Aus den sieben Tagen computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces Music that makes heavy use randomness and chance called aleatoric music and associated with contemporary composers active the 20th century such John Cage Morton Feldman and Witold Lutosawski more commonly known example chancebased music the sound wind chimes jingling breeze The study composition has traditionally been dominated examination methods and practice Western classical music but the definition composition broad enough include the creation popular music and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces well spontaneously improvised works like those free jazz performers and African percussionists such Ewe drummers the 2000s music notation typically means the written expression music notes and rhythms paper using symbols When music written down the pitches and rhythm the music such the notes melody are notated Music notation also often provides instructions how perform the music For example the sheet music for song may state that the song slow blues fast swing which indicates the tempo and the genre read music notation person must have understanding music theory harmony and the performance practice associated with particular song pieces genre Written notation varies with style and period music the 2000s notated music produced sheet music for individuals with computer scorewriter programs image computer screen ancient times music notation was put onto stone clay tablets perform music from notation singer instrumentalist requires understanding the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied the symbols and the performance practice that associated with piece music genre genres requiring musical improvisation the performer often plays from music where only the chord changes and form the song are written requiring the performer have great understanding the musics structure harmony and the styles particular genre jazz country music Western art music the most common types written notation are scores which include all the music parts ensemble piece and parts which are the music notation for the individual performers singers popular music jazz and blues the standard musical notation the lead sheet which notates the melody chords lyrics vocal piece and structure the music Fake books are also used jazz they may consist lead sheets simply chord charts which permit rhythm section members improvise accompaniment part jazz songs Scores and parts are also used popular music and jazz particularly large ensembles such jazz big bands popular music guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated tablature often abbreviated tab which indicates the location the notes played the instrument using diagram the guitar bass fingerboard Tabulature was also used the Baroque era notate music for the lute stringed fretted instrument Musical improvisation the creation spontaneous music often within based preexisting harmonic framework chord progression Improvisation the act instantaneous composition performers where compositional techniques are employed with without preparation Improvisation major part some types music such blues jazz and jazz fusion which instrumental performers improvise solos melody lines and accompaniment parts the Western art music tradition improvisation was important skill during the Baroque era and during the Classical era the Baroque era performers improvised ornaments and basso continuo keyboard players improvised chord voicings based figured bass notation the Classical era solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso cadenzas during concerts However the 20th and early 21st century common practice Western art music performance became institutionalized symphony orchestras opera houses and ballets improvisation has played smaller role the same time some modern composers have increasingly included improvisation their creative work Indian classical music improvisation core component and essential criterion performances Music theory encompasses the nature and mechanics music often involves identifying patterns that govern composers techniques and examining the language and notation music grand sense music theory distills and analyzes the parameters elements music rhythm harmony harmonic function melody structure form and texture Broadly music theory may include any statement belief conception about music People who study these properties are known music theorists Some have applied acoustics human physiology and psychology the explanation how and why music perceived Music has many different fundamentals elements Depending the definition element being used these can include pitch beat pulse tempo rhythm melody harmony texture style allocation voices timbre color dynamics expression articulation form and structure The elements music feature prominently the music curriculums Australia and All three curriculums identify pitch dynamics timbre and texture elements but the other identified elements music are far from universally agreed Below list the three official versions the elements music relation the curriculum 2013 the term appropriate musical notations was added their list elements and the title the list was changed from the elements music the interrelated dimensions music The interrelated dimensions music are listed pitch duration dynamics tempo timbre texture structure and appropriate musical notations The phrase the elements music used number different contexts The two most common contexts can differentiated describing them the rudimentary elements music and the perceptual elements music the 1800s the phrases the elements music and the rudiments music were used interchangeably The elements described these documents refer aspects music that are needed order become musician Recent writers such Estrella seem using the phrase elements music similar manner definition which most accurately reflects this usage the rudimentary principles art science etc the elements grammar The UKs curriculum switch the interrelated dimensions music seems move back using the rudimentary elements music Since the emergence the study psychoacoustics the 1930s most lists elements music have related more how hear music than how learn play study Seashore his book Psychology Music identified four psychological attributes sound These were pitch loudness time and timbre did not call them the elements music but referred them elemental components Nonetheless these elemental components link precisely with four the most common musical elements Pitch and timbre match exactly loudness links with dynamics and time links with the timebased elements rhythm duration and tempo This usage the phrase the elements music links more closely with Websters New 20th Century Dictionary definition element substance which cannot divided into simpler form known methods and educational institutions lists elements generally align with this definition well Although writers lists rudimentary elements music can vary their lists depending their personal institutional priorities the perceptual elements music should consist established proven list discrete elements which can independently manipulated achieve intended musical effect seems this stage that there still research done this area Some styles music place emphasis certain these fundamentals while others place less emphasis certain elements give one example while Bebopera jazz makes use very complex chords including altered dominants and challenging chord progressions with chords changing two more times per bar and keys changing several times tune funk places most its emphasis rhythm and groove with entire songs based around vamp single chord While Romantic era classical music from the mid late1800s makes great use dramatic changes dynamics from whispering pianissimo sections thunderous fortissimo sections some entire Baroque dance suites for harpsichord from the early 1700s may use single dynamic give another example while some art music pieces such symphonies are very long some pop songs are just few minutes long Pitch aspect sound that can hear reflecting whether one musical sound note tone higher lower than another musical sound note tone can talk about the highness lowness pitch the more general sense such the way listener hears piercingly high piccolo note whistling tone higher pitch than deep thump bass drum also talk about pitch the precise sense associated with musical melodies basslines and chords Precise pitch can only determined sounds that have frequency that clear and stable enough distinguish from noise For example much easier for listeners discern the pitch single note played piano than try discern the pitch crash cymbal that struck melody also called tune series pitches notes sounding succession one after the other often rising and falling pattern The notes melody are typically created using pitch systems such scales modes Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used the song The melodies simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes single scale the scale associated with the tonic note key given song For example folk song the key also referred major may have melody that uses only the notes the major scale the individual notes and these are the white notes piano keyboard the other hand Bebopera jazz from the 1940s and contemporary music from the 20th and 21st centuries may use melodies with many chromatic notes notes addition the notes the major scale piano chromatic scale would include all the notes the keyboard including the white notes and black notes and unusual scales such the whole tone scale whole tone scale the key would contain the notes and low deep musical line played bass instruments such double bass electric bass tuba called bassline Harmony refers the vertical sounds pitches music which means pitches that are played sung together the same time create chord Usually this means the notes are played the same time although harmony may also implied melody that outlines harmonic structure using melody notes that are played one after the other outlining the notes chord music written using the system majorminor tonality keys which includes most classical music written from 1600 1900 and most Western pop rock and traditional music the key piece determines the scale used which centres around the home note tonic the key Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written that all the music single key More complex Classical pop and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys and some cases three more keys Classical music from the Romantic era written from about 18201900 often contains multiple keys does jazz especially Bebop jazz from the 1940s which the key home note song may change every four bars even every two bars Rhythm the arrangement sounds and silences time Meter animates time regular pulse groupings called measures bars which Western classical popular and traditional music often group notes sets two time three time also known Waltz time time four time Meters are made easier hear because songs and pieces often but not always place emphasis the first beat each grouping Notable exceptions exist such the backbeat used much Western pop and rock which song that uses measure that consists four beats called time common time will have accents beats two and four which are typically performed the drummer the snare drum loud and distinctivesounding percussion instrument pop and rock the rhythm parts song are played the rhythm section which includes chordplaying instruments electric guitar acoustic guitar piano other keyboard instruments bass instrument typically electric bass for some styles such jazz and bluegrass double bass and drum kit player Musical texture the overall sound piece music song The texture piece sing determined how the melodic rhythmic and harmonic materials are combined composition thus determining the overall nature the sound piece Texture often described regard the density thickness and range width between lowest and highest pitches relative terms well more specifically distinguished according the number voices parts and the relationship between these voices see common types below For example thick texture contains many layers instruments One these layers could string section another brass The thickness also affected the amount and the richness the instruments Texture commonly described according the number and relationship between parts lines music Music that contains large number independent parts double concerto accompanied 100 orchestral instruments with many interweaving melodic lines generally said have thicker denser texture than work with few parts solo flute melody accompanied single cello Timbre sometimes called color tone color the quality sound voice instrument Timbre what makes particular musical sound different from another even when they have the same pitch and loudness For example 440Hz note sounds different when played oboe piano violin electric guitar Even different players the same instrument play the same note their notes might sound different due differences instrumental technique different embouchures different types accessories mouthpieces for brass players reeds for oboe and bassoon players strings made out different materials for string players gut strings versus steel strings Even two instrumentalists playing the same note the same instrument one after the other may sound different due different ways playing the instrument two string players might hold the bow differently The physical characteristics sound that determine the perception timbre include the spectrum envelope and overtones note musical sound For electric instruments developed the 20th century such electric guitar electric bass and electric piano the performer can also change the tone adjusting equalizer controls tone controls the instrument and using electronic effects units such distortion pedals The tone the electric Hammond organ controlled adjusting drawbars Expressive qualities are those elements music that create change music without changing the main pitches substantially changing the rhythms the melody and its accompaniment Performers including singers and instrumentalists can add musical expression song piece adding phrasing adding effects such vibrato with voice and some instruments such guitar violin brass instruments and woodwinds dynamics the loudness softness piece section tempo fluctuations ritardando accelerando which are respectively slowing down and speeding the tempo adding pauses fermatas cadence and changing the articulation the notes making notes more pronounced accented making notes more legato which means smoothly connected making notes shorter Expression achieved through the manipulation pitch such inflection vibrato slides etc volume dynamics accent tremolo etc duration tempo fluctuations rhythmic changes changing note duration such with legato and staccato etc timbre changing vocal timbre from light resonant voice and sometimes even texture doubling the bass note for richer effect piano piece Expression therefore can seen manipulation all elements order convey indication mood spirit character etc and such cannot included unique perceptual element music although can considered important rudimentary element music music form describes how the overall structure plan song piece music and describes the layout composition divided into sections the early 20th century Tin Pan Alley songs and Broadway musical songs were often AABA bar form which the sections repeated the same eight bar melody and the section provided contrasting melody andor harmony for bars From the 1960s onward Western pop and rock songs are often versechorus form which based around sequence verse and chorus refrain sections with new lyrics for most verses and repeating lyrics for the choruses Popular music often makes use strophic form sometimes conjunction with the twelve bar bluescitation needed the tenth edition The Oxford Companion Music Percy Scholes defines musical form series strategies designed find successful mean between the opposite extremes unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration Examples common forms Western music include the fugue the invention sonataallegro canon strophic theme and variations and rondoScholes states that European classical music had only six standalone forms simple binary simple ternary compound binary rondo air with variations and fugue although musicologist Alfred Mann emphasized that the fugue primarily method composition that has sometimes taken certain structural conventions Where piece cannot readily broken down into sectional units though might borrow some form from poem story programme said throughcomposed Such often the case with fantasia prelude rhapsody etude study symphonic poem Bagatelle impromptu etccitation needed Professor Charles Keil classified forms and formal detail sectional developmental variational This form built from sequence clearcut units that may referred letters but also often have generic names such introduction and coda exposition development and recapitulation verse chorus refrain and bridge Introductions and codas when they are more than that are frequently excluded from formal analysis All such units may typically eight measures long Sectional forms include This form defined its unrelieved repetition AAAA Medley potpourri the extreme opposite that unrelieved variation simply indefinite sequence selfcontained sections ABCD sometimes with repeats AABBCCDD Examples include orchestral overtures which are sometimes more than string the best tunes the musical theatre show opera come This form uses two sections each often repeated AABB 18thcentury Western classical music simple binary form was often used for dances and carried with the convention that the two sections should different musical keys but same rhythm duration and tone The alternation two tunes gives enough variety permit dance extended for long desiredb This form has three parts Western classical music simple ternary form has third section that recapitulation the first ABA Often the first section repeated AABA This approach was popular the 18thcentury operatic ariacitation needed and was called capo repeat from the top form Later gave rise the 32bar song with the section then often referred the middle eight song has more need than dance selfcontained form with beginning and end course This form has recurring theme alternating with different usually contrasting sections called episodes may asymmetrical ABACADAEA symmetrical ABACABA recurring section especially the main theme sometimes more thoroughly varied else one episode may development similar arrangement the ritornello form the Baroque concerto grosso Arch form ABCBA resembles symmetrical rondo without intermediate repetitions the main theme normally used round Variational forms are those which variation important formative element Theme and Variations theme which itself can any shorter form binary ternary etc forms the only section and repeated indefinitely strophic form but varied each time make sort sectional chain form important variant this much used 17thcentury British music and the Passacaglia and Chaconne was that the ground bass repeating bass theme basso ostinato over and around which the rest the structure unfolds often but not always spinning polyphonic contrapuntal threads improvising divisions and descants This said Scholes 1977 the form par excellence unaccompanied accompanied solo instrumental music The Rondo often found with sections varied AA1BA2CA3BA4 ABA1CA2B1A Developmental forms are built directly from smaller units such motifs wellknown Classical piece with motif Beethovens fifth symphony which starts with three short repeated notes and then long note Classical pieces that are based motifs the motif usually combined varied and worked out different ways perhaps having symmetrical archlike underpinning and progressive development from beginning end far the most important developmental form Western classical music Sonata formThis form also known sonata form first movement form compound binary ternary and variety other namesexample needed developed from the binaryformed dance movement described above but almost always cast greater ternary form having the nominal subdivisions Exposition Development and Recapitulation Usually but not always the parts Exposition and Recapitulation respectively may subdivided into two three themes theme groups which are taken asunder and recombined form the part the development thus AabBdev andor bA1ab1coda This developmental form generally confined certain sections the piece the middle section the first movement sonata though 19thcentury composers such Berlioz Liszt and Wagner made valiant efforts derive largescale works purely mainly from the motif Prehistoric music can only theorized based findings from paleolithic archaeology sites Flutes are often discovered carved from bones which lateral holes have been pierced these are thought have been blown one end like the Japanese shakuhachi The Divje Babe flute carved from cave bear femur thought least

supplications The Journal Religion and Theatre notes that among the earliest forms litany Hebrew litany was accompanied rich musical tradition Music was important part social and cultural life ancient Greece Musicians and singers played prominent role Greek theater Mixedgender choruses performed for entertainment celebration and spiritual ceremonies Instruments included the doublereed aulos and plucked string instrument the lyre principally the special kind called kithara Music was important part education and boys were taught music starting age six Greek musical literacy created flowering music development Greek music theory included the Greek musical modes that eventually became the basis for Western religious and classical music Later influences from the Roman Empire Eastern Europe and the Byzantine Empire changed Greek music The Seikilos epitaph the oldest surviving example complete musical composition including musical notation from anywhere the world The oldest surviving work written the subject music theory Harmonika Stoicheia Aristoxenus The medieval era 476 1400 which took place during the Middle Ages started with the introduction monophonic single melodic line chanting into Roman Catholic Church services Musical notation was used since Ancient times Greek culture but the Middle Ages notation was first introduced the Catholic church that the chant melodies could written down facilitate the use the same melodies for religious music across the entire Catholic empire The only European Medieval repertory that has been found written form from before 800 the monophonic liturgical plainsong chant the Roman Catholic Church the central tradition which was called Gregorian chant Alongside these traditions sacred and church music there existed vibrant tradition secular song nonreligious songs Examples composers from this period are Lonin Protin Guillaume Machaut and Walther von der Vogelweide Renaissance music 1400 1600 was more focused secular nonreligious themes such courtly love Around 1450 the printing press was invented which made printed sheet music much less expensive and easier massproduce prior the invention the printing press all notated music was handcopied The increased availability sheet music helped spread musical styles more quickly and across larger area Musicians and singers often worked for the church courts and towns Church choirs grew size and the church remained important patron music the middle the 15th century composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously Prominent composers from this era include Guillaume Dufay Giovanni Pierluigi Palestrina Thomas Morley and Orlande Lassus musical activity shifted from the church the aristocratic courts kings queens and princes competed for the finest composers Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands Belgium and northern France They are called the FrancoFlemish composers They held important positions throughout Europe especially Italy Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany England and Spain The Baroque era music took place from 1600 1750 the Baroque artistic style flourished across Europe and during this time music expanded its range and complexity Baroque music began when the first operas dramatic solo vocal music accompanied orchestra were written During the Baroque era polyphonic contrapuntal music which multiple simultaneous independent melody lines were used remained important counterpoint was important the vocal music the Medieval era German Baroque composers wrote for small ensembles including strings brass and woodwinds well for choirs and keyboard instruments such pipe organ harpsichord and clavichord During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further including the fugue the invention the sonata and the concerto The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented Important composers from the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach George Frideric Handel Georg Philipp Telemann and Antonio Lucio Vivaldi The music the Classical period 1730 1820 aimed imitate what were seen the key elements the art and philosophy Ancient Greece and Rome the ideals balance proportion and disciplined expression Note the music from the Classical period should not confused with Classical music general term which refers Western art music from the 5th century the 2000s which includes the Classical period one number periods Music from the Classical period has lighter clearer and considerably simpler texture than the Baroque music which preceded The main style was homophony where prominent melody and subordinate chordal accompaniment part are clearly distinct Classical instrumental melodies tended almost voicelike and singable New genres were developed and the fortepiano the forerunner the modern piano replaced the Baroque era harpsichord and pipe organ the main keyboard instrument Importance was given instrumental music was dominated further development musical forms initially defined the Baroque period the sonata the concerto and the symphony Others main kinds were the trio string quartet serenade and divertimento The sonata was the most important and developed form Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas the Classical style sonata completely distinct All the main instrumental forms the Classical era from string quartets symphonies and concertos were based the structure the sonata The instruments used chamber music and orchestra became more standardized place the basso continuo group the Baroque era which consisted harpsichord organ lute along with number bass instruments selected the discretion the group leader viol cello theorbo serpent Classical chamber groups used specified standardized instruments string quartet would performed two violins viola and cello The Baroque era improvised chordplaying the continuo keyboardist lute player was gradually phased out between 1750 and 1800 One the most important changes made the Classical period was the development public concerts The aristocracy still played significant role the sponsorship concerts and compositions but was now possible for composers survive without being permanent employees queens princes The increasing popularity classical music led growth the number and types orchestras The expansion orchestral concerts necessitated the building large public performance spaces Symphonic music including symphonies musical accompaniment ballet and mixed vocalinstrumental genres such opera and oratorio became more popular The best known composers Classicism are Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach Christoph Willibald Gluck Johann Christian Bach Joseph Haydn Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert Beethoven and Schubert are also considered composers the later part the Classical era began move towards Romanticism Romantic music 1810 1900 from the 19th century had many elements common with the Romantic styles literature and painting the era Romanticism was artistic literary and intellectual movement was characterized its emphasis emotion and individualism well glorification all the past and nature Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms the Classical era into more passionate dramatic expressive pieces and songs Romantic composers such Wagner and Brahms attempted increase emotional expression and power their music describe deeper truths human feelings With symphonic tone poems composers tried tell stories and evoke images landscapes using instrumental music Some composers promoted nationalistic pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired folk music The emotional and expressive qualities music came take precedence over tradition Romantic composers grew idiosyncrasy and went further the syncretism exploring different artforms musical context such literature history historical figures and legends nature itself Romantic love longing was prevalent theme many works composed during this period some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued used the sonata form used string quartets and symphonies but these forms were expanded and altered many cases new approaches were explored for existing genres forms and functions Also new forms were created that were deemed better suited the new subject matter Composers continued develop opera and ballet music exploring new styles and themes the years after 1800 the music developed Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert introduced more dramatic expressive style Beethovens case short motifs developed organically came replace melody the most significant compositional unit example the distinctive four note figure used his Fifth Symphony Later Romantic composers such Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky Antonn Dvok and Gustav Mahler used more unusual chords and more dissonance create dramatic tension They generated complex and often much longer musical works During the late Romantic period composers explored dramatic chromatic alterations tonality such extended chords and altered chords which created new sound colours The late 19th century saw dramatic expansion the size the orchestra and the industrial revolution helped create better instruments creating more powerful sound Public concerts became important part welltodo urban society also saw new diversity theatre music including operetta and musical comedy and other forms musical theatre the 19th century one the key ways that new compositions became known the public was the sales sheet music which middle class amateur music lovers would perform home their piano other common instruments such violin With 20thcentury music the invention new electric technologies such radio broadcasting and the mass market availability gramophone records meant that sound recordings songs and pieces heard listeners either the radio their record player became the main way learn about new songs and pieces There was vast increase music listening the radio gained popularity and phonographs were used replay and distribute music because whereas the 19th century the focus sheet music restricted access new music the middle class and upperclass people who could read music and who owned pianos and instruments the 20th century anyone with radio record player could hear operas symphonies and big bands right their own living room This allowed lowerincome people who would never able afford opera symphony concert ticket hear this music also meant that people could hear music from different parts the country even different parts the world even they could not afford travel these locations This helped spread musical styles The focus art music the 20th century was characterized exploration new rhythms styles and sounds The horrors World War influenced many the arts including music and some composers began exploring darker harsher sounds Traditional music styles such jazz and folk music were used composers source ideas for classical music Igor Stravinsky Arnold Schoenberg and John Cage were all influential composers 20thcentury art music The invention sound recording and the ability edit music gave rise new subgenre classical music including the acousmatic and Musique concrte schools electronic composition Sound recording was also major influence the development popular music genres because enabled recordings songs and bands widely distributed The introduction the multitrack recording system had major influence rock music because could much more than record bands performance Using multitrack system band and their music producer could overdub many layers instrument tracks and vocals creating new sounds that would not possible live performance Jazz evolved and became important genre music over the course the 20th century and during the second half that century rock music did the same Jazz American musical artform that originated the beginning the 20th century African American communities the Southern United States from confluence African and European music traditions The styles West African pedigree evident its use blue notes improvisation polyrhythms syncopation and the swung note Rock music genre popular music that developed the 1960s from 1950s rock and roll rockabilly blues and country music The sound rock often revolves around the electric guitar acoustic guitar and uses strong back beat laid down rhythm section electric bass guitar drums and keyboard instruments such organ piano since the 1970s analog synthesizers and digital ones and computers since the 1990s Along with the guitar keyboards saxophone and bluesstyle

festivals music competitions Chamber music which music for small ensemble with only few each type instrument often seen more intimate than large symphonic works Many types music such traditional blues

melody bassline other musical part The detail included explicitly the music notation varies between genres and historical periods general art music notation from the 17th through the 19th centuries required performers have great deal contextual knowledge about performing styles For example the 17th and 18th centuries music notated for solo performers typically indicated simple unadorned melody However performers were expected know how add stylistically appropriate ornaments add interest the music such trills and turns the 19th century art music for solo performers may give general instruction such perform the music expressively without describing detail how the performer should this The performer was expected know how use tempo changes accentuation and pauses among other devices obtain this expressive performance style the 20th century art music notation often became more explicit and used range markings and annotations indicate performers how they should play sing the piece Philosophy music subfield philosophy The philosophy music the study fundamental questions regarding music The philosophical study music has many connections with philosophical questions metaphysics and aestheticsSome basic questions the philosophy music are ancient times such with the Ancient Greeks the aesthetics music explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions rhythmic and harmonic organization the 18th century focus shifted the experience hearing music and thus questions about its beauty and human enjoyment plaisir and jouissance music The origin this philosophic shift sometimes attributed Baumgarten the 18th century followed Kant Through their writing the ancient term aesthetics meaning sensory perception received its presentday connotation the 2000s philosophers have tended emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment For example musics capacity express emotion has been central issue the 20th century important contributions were made Peter Kivy Jerrold Levinson Roger Scruton and Stephen Davies However many musicians music critics and other nonphilosophers have contributed the aesthetics music the 19th century significant debate arose between Eduard Hanslick music critic and musicologist and composer Richard Wagner regarding whether music can express meaning Harry Partch and some other musicologists such Kyle Gann have studied and tried popularize microtonal music and the usage alternate musical scales Also many modern composers like Monte Young Rhys Chatham and Glenn Branca paid much attention scale called just intonation often thought that music has the ability affect our emotions intellect and psychology can assuage our loneliness incite our passions The philosopher Plato suggests the Republic that music has direct effect the soul Therefore proposes that the ideal regime music would closely regulated the state Book VII There has been strong tendency the aesthetics music emphasize the paramount importance compositional structure however other issues concerning the aesthetics music include lyricism harmony hypnotism emotiveness temporal dynamics resonance playfulness and color see also musical development Modern music psychology aims explain and understand musical behavior and experience Research this field and its subfields are primarily empirical their knowledge tends advance the basis interpretations data collected systematic observation and interaction with human participants addition its focus fundamental perceptions and cognitive processes music psychology field research with practical relevance for many areas including music performance composition education criticism and therapy well investigations human aptitude skill intelligence creativity and social behavior Cognitive neuroscience music the scientific study brainbased mechanisms involved the cognitive processes underlying music These behaviours include music listening performing composing reading writing and ancillary activities also increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion The field distinguished its reliance direct observations the brain using such techniques functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS magnetoencephalography MEG electroencephalography EEG and positron emission tomography PET Cognitive musicology branch cognitive science concerned with computationally modeling musical knowledge with the goal understanding both music and cognition The use computer models provides exacting interactive medium which formulate and test theories and has roots artificial intelligence and cognitive science This interdisciplinary field investigates topics such the parallels between language and music the brain Biologically inspired models computation are often included research such neural networks and evolutionary programs This field seeks model how musical knowledge represented stored perceived performed and generated using wellstructured computer environment the systematic structures these cognitive phenomena can investigated Psychoacoustics the scientific study sound perception More specifically the branch science studying the psychological and physiological responses associated with sound including speech and music can further categorized branch psychophysics Evolutionary musicology concerns the origins music the question animal song selection pressures underlying music evolution and music evolution and human evolution seeks understand music perception and activity the context evolutionary theory Charles Darwin speculated that music may have held adaptive advantage and functioned protolanguage view which has spawned several competing theories music evolution alternate view sees music byproduct linguistic evolution type auditory cheesecake that pleases the senses without providing any adaptive function This view has been directly countered numerous music researchers individuals culture ethnicity plays role their music cognition including their preferences emotional reaction and musical memory Musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning infancy and adults classification the emotion musical piece depends both culturally specific and universal structural features Additionally individuals musical memory abilities are greater for culturally familiar music than for culturally unfamiliar music Many ethnographic studies demonstrate that music participatory communitybased activity Music experienced individuals range social settings ranging from being alone attending large concert forming music community which cannot understood function individual will accident includes both commercial and noncommercial participants with shared set common values Musical performances take different forms different cultures and socioeconomic milieus Europe and North America there often divide between what types music are viewed high culture and low culture High culture types music typically include Western art music such Baroque Classical Romantic and modernera symphonies concertos and solo works and are typically heard formal concerts concert halls and churches with the audience sitting quietly seats Other types musicincluding but not limited jazz blues soul and countryare often performed bars nightclubs and theatres where the audience may able drink dance and express themselves cheering Until the later 20th century the division between high and low musical forms was widely accepted valid distinction that separated out better quality more advanced art music from the popular styles music heard bars and dance halls However the 1980s and 1990s musicologists studying this perceived divide between high and low musical genres argued that this distinction not based the musical value quality the different types musiccitation needed Rather they argued that this distinction was based largely the socioeconomics standing social class the performers audience the different types musiccitation needed For example whereas the audience for Classical symphony concerts typically have aboveaverage incomes the audience for rap concert innercity area may have belowaverage incomescitation needed Even though the performers audience venue where nonart music performed may have lower socioeconomic status the music that performed such blues rap punk funk ska may very complex and sophisticated When composers introduce styles music that break with convention there can strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture Lateperiod Beethoven string quartets Stravinsky ballet scores serialism bebopera jazz hip hop punk rock and electronica have all been considered nonmusic some critics when they were first introducedcitation needed Such themes are examined the sociology music The sociological study music sometimes called sociomusicology often pursued departments sociology media studies music and closely related the field ethnomusicology Women have played major role music throughout history composers songwriters instrumental performers singers conductors music scholars music educators music

popular music and classical music singers and significant proportion songwriters many them being singersongwriters there are few women record producers rock critics and rock instrumentalists Although there have been huge number women composers classical music from the Medieval period the present day women composers are significantly underrepresented the commonly performed classical music repertoire music history textbooks and music encyclopedias for example the Concise Oxford History Music Clara Schumann one the only female composers who mentioned Women comprise significant proportion instrumental soloists classical music and the percentage women orchestras increasing 2015 article concerto soloists major Canadian orchestras however indicated that the soloists with the Orchestre Symphonique Montreal were men 2012 women still made just the topranked Vienna Philharmonic orchestra Women are less common instrumental players popular music genres such rock and heavy metal although there have been number notable female instrumentalists and allfemale bands Women are particularly underrepresented extreme metal genres the 1960s popmusic scene like most aspects themusic business the 1960s songwriting was maledominated field Though there were plenty female singers the radio women were primarily seen consumers Singing was sometimes acceptable pastime for girl but playing instrument writing songs producing records simply wasnt done Young women were not socialized see themselves people who create music Women are also underrepresented orchestral conducting music criticismmusic journalism music producing and sound engineering While women were discouraged from composing the 19th century and there are few women musicologists women became involved music education such degree that women dominated this field during the later half the 19th century and well into the 20th century According Jessica Duchen music writer for Londons The Independent women musicians classical music are too often judged for their appearances rather than their talent and they face pressure look sexy onstage and photos Duchen states that while there are women musicians who refuse play their looksthe ones who tend more materially successfulAccording the UKs Radio editor Edwina Wolstencroft the music industry has long been open having women performance entertainment roles but women are much less likely have positions authority such being the leader orchestra popular music while there are many women singers recording songs there are very few women behind the audio console acting music producers the individuals who direct and manage the recording process One the most recorded artists Asha Bhosle Indian singer best known playback singer Hindi cinemacitation needed The music that composers make can heard through several media the most traditional way hear live the presence the musicians one the musicians outdoor indoor space such amphitheatre concert hall cabaret room theatre Since the 20th century live music can also broadcast over the radio television the Internet recorded and listened player Mp3 player Some musical styles focus producing sound for performance while others focus producing recording that mixes together sounds that were never played live Recording even essentially live styles such rock often uses the ability edit and splice produce recordings that may considered better than the actual performance Technology has had influence music since prehistoric times when cave people used simple tools bore holes into bone flutes 41000 years ago Technology continued influence music throughout the history music enabled new instruments and music notation reproduction systems used with one the watershed moments music notation being the invention the printing press the 1400s which meant music scores longer had hand copied the 19th century music technology led the development more powerful louder piano and led the development new valves brass instruments the early 20th century the late 1920s talking pictures emerged the early 20th century with their prerecorded musical tracks increasing number moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out work During the 1920s live musical performances orchestras pianists and theater organists were common firstrun theaters With the coming the talking motion pictures those featured performances were largely eliminated The American Federation Musicians AFM took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement live musicians with mechanical playing devices One 1929 that appeared the Pittsburgh Press features image can labeled Canned Music Big Noise Brand Guaranteed Produce Intellectual Emotional Reaction Whatever Since legislation introduced help protect performers composers publishers and producers including the Audio Home Recording Act 1992 the United States and the 1979 revised Berne Convention for the Protection Literary and Artistic Works the United Kingdom recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through computers devices and Internet form that commonly known MusicOnDemand many cultures there less distinction between performing and listening music since virtually everyone involved some sort musical activity often communal industrialized countries listening music through recorded form such sound recording watching music video became more common than experiencing live performance roughly the middle the 20th century Sometimes live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds For example disc jockey uses disc records for scratching and some 20thcentury works have solo for instrument voice that performed along with music that prerecorded onto tape Computers and many keyboards can programmed produce and play Musical Instrument Digital Interface MIDI music Audiences can also become performers participating karaoke activity Japanese origin centered device that plays voiceeliminated versions wellknown songs Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics songs being performed performers can follow the lyrics they sing over the instrumental tracks The advent the Internet and widespread highspeed broadband access has transformed the experience music partly through the increased ease access recordings music via streaming video and vastly increased choice music for consumers Chris Anderson his book The Long Tail Why the Future Business Selling Less More suggests that while the traditional economic model supply and demand describes scarcity the Internet retail model based abundance Digital storage costs are low company can afford make its whole recording inventory available online giving customers much choice possible has thus become economically viable offer music recordings that very few people are interested Consumers growing awareness their increased choice results closer association between listening tastes and social identity and the creation thousands niche markets Another effect the Internet arose with online communities and social media websites like YouTube and Facebook social networking service These sites make easier for aspiring singers and amateur bands distribute videos their songs connect with other musicians and gain audience interest Professional musicians also use YouTube free publisher promotional material YouTube users for example longer only download and listen MP3s but also actively create their own According Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams their book Wikinomics there has been shift from traditional consumer role what they call prosumer role consumer who both creates content and consumes Manifestations this music include the production mashes remixes and music videos fans The music industry refers the businesses connected with the creation and sale music consists songwriters and composers who create new songs and musical pieces music producers and sound engineers who record songs and pieces record labels and publishers that distribute recorded music products and sheet music internationally and that often control the rights those products Some music labels are independent while others are subsidiaries larger corporate entities international media groups the 2000s the increasing popularity listening music digital music files MP3 players iPods computers and trading music file sharing websites buying online the form digital files had major impact the traditional music business Many smaller independent stores went out business music buyers decreased their purchases CDs and many labels had lower sales Some companies did well with the change digital format though such Apples iTunes online music store that sells digital files songs over the Internet spite some international copyright treaties determining which music the public domain complicated the variety national copyright laws that may applicable copyright law formerly protected printed music published after 1923 for years and with renewal for another years but the Copyright Act 1976 made renewal automatic and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act changed the calculation the copyright term years after the death the creator Recorded sound falls under mechanical licensing often covered confusing patchwork state laws most cover versions are licensed through the Harry Fox Agency Performance rights may obtained either performers the performance venue the two major organizations for licensing are BMI and ASCAP Two online sources for public domain music are IMSLP International Music Score Library Project and Choral Public Domain Library CPDL The incorporation some music singing training into general education from preschool post secondary education common North America and Europe Involvement playing and singing music thought teach basic skills such concentration counting listening and cooperation while also promoting understanding language improving the ability recall information and creating environment more conducive learning other areas elementary schools children often learn play instruments such the recorder sing small choirs and learn about the history Western art music and traditional music Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles religious schools children sing hymns and other religious music secondary schools and less commonly elementary schools students may have the opportunity perform some types musical ensembles such choirs group singers marching bands concert bands jazz bands orchestras some school systems music lessons how play instruments may provided Some students also take private music lessons after school with singing teacher instrument teacher Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments learning about musical notation for musical scales and rhythms and beginner intermediatelevel singing instrumentplaying techniques the university level students most arts and humanities programs can receive credit for taking few music courses which typically take the form overview course the history music music appreciation course that focuses listening music and learning about different musical styles addition most North American and European universities have some types musical ensembles that students arts and humanities are able participate such choirs marching bands concert bands orchestras The study Western art music increasingly common outside North America and Europe such the Indonesian Institute the Arts Yogyakarta Indonesia the classical music programs that are available Asian countries such South Korea Japan and China the same time Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum include music nonWestern cultures such the music Africa Bali Gamelan music Individuals aiming become professional musicians singers composers songwriters music teachers and practitioners other musicrelated professions such music history professors sound engineers and study specialized postsecondary programs offered colleges universities and music conservatories Some institutions that train individuals for careers music offer training wide range professions the case with many the top universities which offer degrees music performance including singing and playing instruments music history music theory music composition music education for individuals aiming become elementary high school music teachers and some cases conducting the other hand some small colleges may only offer training single profession sound recording While most university and conservatory music programs focus training students classical music there are number universities and colleges that train musicians for careers jazz popular music musicians and composers with notable examples including the Manhattan School Music and the Berklee College Music Two important schools Canada which offer professional jazz training are McGill University and Humber College Individuals aiming careers some types music such heavy metal music country music blues are less likely become professionals completing degrees diplomas colleges universities Instead they typically learn about their style music singing andor playing many bands often beginning amateur bands cover bands and tribute bands studying recordings available DVD and the Internet and working with alreadyestablished professionals their style music either through informal mentoring regular music lessons Since the 2000s the increasing popularity and availability Internet forums and YouTube howto videos have enabled many singers and musicians from metal blues and similar genres improve their skills Many pop rock and country singers train informally with vocal coaches and singing teachers Undergraduate university degrees music including the Bachelor Music the Bachelor Music Education and the Bachelor Arts with major music typically take about four years complete These degrees provide students with grounding music theory and music history and many students also study instrument learn singing technique part their program Graduates undergraduate music programs can seek employment further study music graduate programs Bachelors degree graduates are also eligible apply some graduate programs and professional schools outside music public administration business administration library science and some jurisdictions teachers college law school medical school Graduate music degrees include the Master Music the Master Arts musicology music theory another music field the Doctor Philosophy PhD musicology music theory and more recently the Doctor Musical Arts DMA The Master Music degree which takes one two years complete typically awarded students studying the performance instrument education voice singing composition The Master Arts degree which takes one two years complete and often requires thesis typically awarded students studying musicology music history music theory ethnomusicology The PhD which required for students who want work university professors musicology music history music theory takes three five years study after the masters degree during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for dissertation The DMA relatively new degree that was created provide credential for professional performers composers that want work university professors musical performance composition The DMA takes three five years after masters degree and includes advanced courses projects and performances Medieval times the study music was one the Quadrivium the seven Liberal Arts and considered vital higher learning Within the quantitative Quadrivium music more accurately harmonics was the study rational proportions Musicology the academic study the subject music studied universities and music conservatories The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined three subdisciplines musicology systematic musicology historical musicology and comparative musicology ethnomusicology 2010era scholarship one more likely encounter division the discipline into music theory music history and ethnomusicology Research musicology has often been enriched crossdisciplinary work for example the field psychoacoustics The study music nonWestern cultures and the cultural study music called ethnomusicology Students can pursue the undergraduate study musicology ethnomusicology music history and music theory through several different types degrees including bachelors degrees masters degrees and PhD degrees Music theory the study music generally highly technical manner outside other disciplines More broadly refers any study music usually related some form with compositional concerns and may include mathematics physics and anthropology What most commonly taught beginning music theory classes are guidelines write the style the common practice period tonal music Theory even music the common practice period may take many other forms Musical set theory the application mathematical set theory music first applied atonal music Speculative music theory contrasted with analytic music theory devoted the analysis and synthesis music materials for example tuning systems generally preparation for composition Zoomusicology the study the music nonhuman animals the musical aspects sounds produced nonhuman animals George Herzog 1941 asked animals have music FranoisBernard Mches Musique mythe nature les Dauphins dArion 1983 study ornithomusicology using technique Nicolas Ruwets Langage musique posie 1972 paradigmatic segmentation analysis shows that bird songs are

acknowledge that sound not organised and conceptualised that made form music merely its producer but the mind that perceives then music uniquely human the West much the history music that taught deals with the Western civilizations art music which known classical music The history music nonWestern cultures world music the field ethnomusicology which typically covers music fromAfrica and Asia also taught Western universities This includes the documented classical traditions Asian countries outside the influence Western Europe well the folk indigenous music various other cultures Popular folk styles music nonWestern countries varied widely from culture culture and from period period Different cultures emphasised different instruments techniques singing styles and uses for music Music has been used for entertainment ceremonies rituals religious purposes and for practical and artistic communication NonWestern music has also been used for propaganda purposes was the case with Chinese opera during the Cultural Revolution There host music classifications for nonWestern music many which are caught the argument over the definition music Among the largest these the division between classical music art music and popular music commercial music including nonWestern styles rock country and pop musicrelated styles Some genres not fit neatly into one these big two classifications such folk music world music jazzrelated music world cultures have come into greater global contact their indigenous musical styles have often merged with other styles which produces new styles For example the United States bluegrass style contains elements from AngloIrish Scottish Irish German and African instrumental and vocal traditions which were able fuse the United States multiethnic melting pot society Some types world music contain mixture nonWestern indigenous styles with Western pop music elements Genres music are determined much tradition and presentation the actual music Some works like George Gershwins Rhapsody Blue are claimed both jazz and classical music while Gershwins Porgy and Bess and Leonard Bernsteins West Side Story are claimed both opera and the Broadway musical tradition Many current music festivals for nonWestern music include bands and singers from particular musical genre such world music Indian music for example one the oldest and longest living types music and

lover more enamoured religious man more devout the Ottoman Empire mental illnesses were treated with music November 2006 Michael Crawford and his colleagues also found that music therapy helped schizophrenic patients Albert Einstein had lifelong love music particularly the works Bach and Mozart once stating that life without playing music would inconceivable him some interviews Einstein even attributed much his scientific intuition music with his son Hans recounting that whenever felt that had come the end the road into difficult situation his work would take refuge music and that would usually resolve all his difficulties Something the music according Michele and Robert RootBernstein Psychology Today would guide his thoughts new and creative directions has been said that Einstein considered Mozarts music reveal universal harmony that Einstein believed existed the universe the great Wolfgang Amadeus did not create his beautifully clear music all but simply discovered already
