chord progression harmonic progression succession musical chords which are two more notes typically sounded simultaneously Chord progressions are the foundation harmony Western musical tradition from the common practice era Classical music the 21st century Chord progressions are the foundation Western popular music styles pop music rock music and traditional music blues and jazz these genres chord progressions are the defining feature which melody and rhythm are built tonal music chord progressions have the function establishing contradicting tonality the technical name for what commonly understood the key song piece Chord progressions are usually expressed Roman numerals Classical music theory for example the common chord progression viii many styles popular and traditional music chord progressions are expressed using the name and quality the chords For example the previously mentioned chord progression the key Major would written Major minorD minor fake book lead sheet the first chord Major the indicates that the chord built the root note the word Major indicates that major chord built this note rock and blues musicians also often refer chord progressions using Roman numerals this facilitates transposing song new key For example rock and blues musicians often think the bar blues consisting and chords Thus simple version the 12bar blues might expressed IIII IVIVIIVIVII thinking this blues progression Roman numerals backup band rhythm section could instructed bandleader the chord progression any key For example the bandleader asked the band play this chord progression the key Major the chords would CCCC FFCC GFCC the bandleader wanted play the song the key Major the chords would GGGG CCGG DCGG and The complexity chord progression varies from genre genre and over different historical periods Some pop and rock songs from the 1980s the 2010s have fairly simple chord progressions Funk emphasizes the groove and rhythm the key element entire funk songs may based one chord Some jazzfunk songs are based two three fourchord vamp Some punk and hardcore punk songs use only few chords the other hand bebop jazz songs may have bar song forms with one two chord changes every bar chord may built upon any note musical scale therefore sevennote scale allows seven basic chords for that scales key each degree the scale becoming the root its own chord chord built upon the note chord some type majorminordiminished etc The harmonic function any particular chord depends the context the particular chord progression which found See Diatonic function The diatonic scalebased not including notes other than the seven notes the given scale harmonization any major scale results three major triads They are based the first fourth and fifth scale degrees the tonic called the chord Roman numeral analysis the subdominant the chord Roman numeral analysis and dominant the chord see threechord song These three triads include and therefore can harmonize every note that scale Many simple traditional music folk music and rock and roll songs use only these three chord types Wild Thing which uses and chords The same scale also provides three relative minor chords one related each the three major chords These are based upon the sixth second and third degrees the major scale and stand the same relationship one another the relative minor key the three majors that they may viewed the first fourth and fifth degrees the relative minor key For example are the key Major its relative minor key the key minor the key minor the and chords would minor minor and minor practice the dominant chords third often sharpened raised one semitone give major chord well this chord may have dominant seventh added making chord The chords this alteration would minor minor and major Separate from these six common chords there one degree the scale the seventh that results diminished chord Thus the key Major the seventh note the scale would the root note diminished triad the notes and addition extra chromatic notes may added any chord Chromatic notes are notes that are not the key Returning our example song Major this key with sharps flats The key Major the white notes piano Any the chords the key Major can have one more notes their triad sharpened flattened which would require the use Major the black keys Perhaps the most basic chromatic alteration simple folk songs the use the sharpened fourth scale degree song Major the diatonic fourth scale degree Sharpening this fourth degree one semitone gives Thus with the the chord normally the notes and becomes the notes Major chord the technical term for this chord secondary dominant these notes are also selected from the original scale the harmony remains diatonic new chromatic intervals are introduced then change scale modulation occurs which may bring the sense change tonal center commonly called moving new key This turn may lead resolution back the original key that the entire sequence chords helps create extended musical form and sense movement and interest for the listener Although there can large number possible progressions depending upon the length the progression practice progressions are often limited few bars lengths and certain progressions are favored above others There also certain amount fashion which chord progression defined the bar blues progression and may even help defining entire genre western classical notation chords built the scale are numbered with Roman numerals chord will figured the key for example but the key Minor chords are signified lower case Roman that minor the key would written Other forms chord notation have been devised from figured bass the chord chart These usually allow even require certain amount improvisation Diatonic scales such the major and minor scales lend themselves particularly well the construction common chords because they contain large number perfect fifths Such scales predominate those regions where harmony essential part music for example the common practice period western classical music considering Arab and Indian music where diatonic scales are used there are also available number nondiatonic scales the music has chord changes remaining always upon the keychord attribute which has also been observed hard rock hip hop funk disco jazz etc Alternation between two chords may thought the most basic chord progression Many wellknown pieces are built harmonically upon the mere repetition two chords the same scale For example many the more straightforward melodies classical music consist entirely mostly alternation between the tonic and the dominant sometimes with added seventh folk songs such Polly Wolly Doodlecitation needed and popular songs such Achy Breaky Heartcitation needed The Isley Brothers Shout uses throughout Threechord tunes though are more common since melody may then dwell any note the scale They are often presented successions four chords order produce binary harmonic rhythm but two the four chords are then the same Often the chords may selected fit preconceived melody but just often the progression itself that gives rise the melody Similar progressions abound African popular music They may varied the addition sevenths other scale degrees any chord substitution the relative minor the chord give for example This sequence using the chord based the second scale degree also used cadentially common chord progression jazz harmony the socalled iiVI turnaround which are based the more ornate Coltrane changes Such progressions provide the entire harmonic foundation much African and American popular music and they occur sectionally many pieces classical music such the opening bars Beethovens Pastoral Symphonycitation needed Any these progressions may transposed into any key that for instance the progression the key will played while the key the chords will Where such simple sequence does not represent the entire harmonic structure piece may readily extended for greater variety Frequently opening phrase the type which ends unresolved dominant may answered similar version that resolves back onto the home chord giving structure double the length Additionally such passage may alternated with different progression give simple binary ternary form such that the popular thirtytwobar form see musical form The twelve bar blues and its many variants use elongated threeline form the progression that has also generated countless hit records including the most significant output rock and rollers such Chuck Berry and Little Richard its most elementary form there are many variants the chords progress follows Again blues progressions have formed the entire harmonic basis many recorded songs but may also confined single section more elaborate form frequently with The Beatles such songs You Cant That Feel Fine and Shes Womancitation needed They have also been subjected densely chromatic elaboration the Bird blues Steedman 1984 proposed that set recursive rewrite rules generate all wellformed transformations jazz both basic blues chord changes and slightly modified sequences such the rhythm changes Important transformations include Another common way extending the sequence adding the chord the sixth scale degree giving the sequence sometimes called the 50s progression doowop progression fact this sequence had been use from the earliest days classical music used often Wolfgang Amadeus Mozartcitation needed but after generating popular hits such Rodgers and Harts Blue Moon 1934citation needed Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields 1936 The Way You Look Tonightcitation needed and Hoagy Carmichaels Heart and Soul 1938 became associated with the black American vocal groups the 1940s The Ink Spots and The Mills Brothers Till Thencitation needed and thus later became the entire basis the 1950s doowop genre typical example being The Monotones The Book Lovecitation needed Taken into the pop mainstream for example with Felice and Boudleaux Bryants All Have Dreamcitation needed hit for The Everly Brothers the 1960s continued generate records otherwise disparate The Paris Sisters Love How You Love written Mann and Kolber and Boris Picketts Monster Mashcitation needed continued used sectionally the last part The Beatles Happiness Warm Gun and also form the harmonic basis further new songs for decades Every Breath You Take The Police and Madonnas True Bluecitation needed Introducing the chord into these progressions emphasises their appeal constituting elementary forms circle progression These named for the circle fifths consist adjacent roots ascending fourth descending fifth relationshipfor instance the sequence ascends with each successive chord one fourth above the previous Such motion based upon close harmonic relations offers undoubtedly the most common and the strongest all harmonic progressions The succession cadences gives impression inevitable return the keynote the piece Short cyclical progressions may derived selecting sequence chords from the series completing circle from the tonic through all seven diatonic chords This type progression was much used classical composers who introduced increasingly subtle inflections Particularly substitution major for minor chords giving for example allowed more sophisticated chromaticism well the possibility modulation These harmonic conventions were taken American popular entertainers giving rise many variations those harmonic staples early jazz that have been dubbed the ragtime progression and the stomp progression All such progressions may found used sectionally for example the muchused rhythm changes George Gershwins Got Rhythm well the cyclical underpinning chords the ear tends respond well linear thread chords following the scale upwards downwards These are often referred step progressions because they follow the steps the scale making the scale itself bassline the 17th century descending bass lines found favour for divisions the ground that Pachelbels canon the Bach orchestral suites the famous Air Stringcitation needed and Handels organ concerti all contain very similar harmonizations the descending major scalecitation needed When this was reintroduced into mid20th century pop music brought with many baroque trappings The Beatles For Onecitation needed Procol Harums Whiter Shade Palecitation needed and The Steve Miller Bands Dear Mary and Babys Housecitation needed its simplest this descending sequence may simply introduce extra chord either III into the type sequence described above This chord allows the harmonization the seventh step and the bass line VII This strategy underlies Percy Sledges When Man Loves Womancitation needed and Bob Marleys Woman Crycitation needed The baroque examples descend for octave while Whiter Shade Pale manages stately two octaves before turning around through the dominant chord recommence upon the key notecitation needed Ascending major progressions are not common but many exist the verse Like Rolling Stone ascends steps the fifth IiiiiiIVV IiiIiiiIVV before descending again the keynote iii IVIiiiiiIthe latter being another common type harmonization descending major scalecitation needed The Four Pennies hit Julietcitation needed and The Beatles Here There and Everywhere both use similar ascending progressionscitation needed The descending chromatic scale has also formed the basis many progressions from the Crucifixus Bachs Mass minorcitation needed through Beethovens Thirtytwo Piano Variationscitation needed songs such Bob Dylans Simple Twist Fatecitation needed George Harrisons Somethingcitation needed and Lucio Battistis Paradisocitation needed hit for Amen Corner when translated Paradise Half Nicecitation needed The finale measures the first movement Ravels Piano Concerto feature the harmonization descending hybrid scale phrygomajor this special case Ravel used parallel series major triads brilliant effectG Similar strategies all the above work equally well minor modes there have been one two and threeminorchord songs minor bluesA notable example descending minor chord progression the fourchord Andalusian cadencei VII Folk and blues tunes frequently use the Mixolydian scale which has flat seventh degree altering the position the three major chords IVIIIV For example the major scale which gives the three chords and the first fourth and fifth degrees played with the tonic then the same chords will now appear the first fourth and seventh degrees These Mixolydian harmonies also appeared the pop music the 1960s notably with The Beatles album Helpcitation needed and The Rolling Stones Beggars Banquetcitation needed The minorthird step from minor keynote the relative major encouraged ascending scale progressions particularly based ascending pentatonic scale Typical the type the sequence III According Tom Sutcliffe during 1960s some pop groups started experiment with modal chord progressions alternative way harmonizing blues melodies This created new system harmony that has influenced subsequent popular music This came about partly from the similarity the blues scale modal scales and partly from the characteristics the guitar and the use parallel major chords the pentatonic minor scale With barre chords guitar the same chord shape can moved and down the neck without changing the fingering This phenomenon also linked the rise the use power chords heavy metal music Power chords contain just fifth fifth with the root doubled Without third power chords enable more flexibility the chord progression Early European art music developed through embellishment single line melody and classical theory still emphasises the correct horizontal progress singlenote parts sometimes known voice leading Generally the melody the upper part added first bass line and then two inner lines complete the chords fourpart harmony suitable for choir string section terminating with cadences avoiding some chord inversions and favouring others maintaining orderly and melodic conjunct contrary and oblique motion each part relative the others order achieve unity texture avoidance inappropriate intervals parallel fifths and octaves etc Much practice given the art harmonic transition and development that essential classical musics use harmony means achieving unity largescale form While noted above classical music has its cliche progressions they are seldom named and discussedcitation needed perhaps only Schoenberg among the authors popular textbooks harmony has made some
