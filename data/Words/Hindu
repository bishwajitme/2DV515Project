2006 Starting after the 10th century and particularly after the 12th century Islamic invasion states Sheldon Pollock the political response fused with the Indic religious culture and doctrines Temples dedicated deity Rama were built from north south India and textual records well hagiographic inscriptions began comparing the Hindu epic Ramayana regional kings and their response Islamic attacks The Yadava king Devagiri named Ramacandra for example states Pollock described 13thcentury record How this Rama described who freed Varanasi from the mleccha barbarian Turk Muslim horde and built there golden temple Sarngadhara Pollock notes that the Yadava king Ramacandra described devotee deity Shiva Shaivism yet his political achievements and temple construction sponsorship Varanasi far from his kingdoms location the Deccan region described the historical records Vaishnavism terms Rama deity Vishnu avatar Pollock presents many such examples and suggests emerging Hindu political identity that was grounded the Hindu religious text Ramayana one that has continued into the modern times and suggests that this historic process began with the arrival Islam India Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya has questioned the Pollock theory and presented textual and inscriptional evidence According Chattopadhyaya the Hindu identity and religious response Islamic invasion and wars developed different kingdoms such wars between Islamic Sultanates and the Vijayanagara kingdom Karnataka and Islamic raids the kingdoms Tamil Nadu These wars were described not just using the mythical story Rama from Ramayana states Chattopadhyaya the medieval records used wide range religious symbolism and myths that are now considered part Hindu literature This emergence religious with political terminology began with the first Muslim invasion Sindh the 8th century and intensified 13th century onwards The 14thcentury Sanskrit text Madhuravijayam memoir written Gangadevi the wife Vijayanagara prince for example describes the consequences war using religious terms very much lament for what happened the groves MadhuraThe coconut trees have all been cut and their place are seenrows iron spikes with human skulls

historiographic writings Telugu language from the 13th and 14thcentury Kakatiya dynasty period presents similar alien other Turk and selfidentity Hindu contrast Chattopadhyaya and other scholars state that the military and political campaign during the medieval era wars Deccan peninsula India and the north India were longer quest for sovereignty they embodied political and religious animosity against the otherness Islam and this began the historical process Hindu identity formation Andrew Nicholson his review scholarship Hindu identity history states that the vernacular literature Bhakti movement sants from 15th 17th century such Kabir Anantadas Eknath Vidyapati suggests that distinct religious identities between Hindus and Turks Muslims had formed during these centuries The poetry this period contrasts Hindu and Islamic identities states Nicholson and the literature vilifies the Muslims coupled with distinct sense Hindu religious identity Scholars state that Hindu Buddhist and Jain identities are retrospectivelyintroduced modern constructions Inscriptional evidence from the 8th century onwards regions such South India suggests that medieval era India both elite and folk religious practices level likely had shared religious culture and their collective identities were multiple layered and fuzzy Even among Hinduism denominations such Shaivism and Vaishnavism the Hindu identities states Leslie Orr lacked firm definitions and clear boundaries Overlaps JainHindu identities have included Jains worshipping Hindu deities intermarriages between Jains and Hindus and medieval era Jain temples featuring Hindu religious icons and sculpture Beyond India Java island Indonesia historical records attest marriages between Hindus and Buddhists medieval era temple architecture and sculptures that simultaneously incorporate Hindu and Buddhist themes where Hinduism and Buddhism merged and functioned two separate paths within one overall system according Ann Kenney and other scholars Similarly there organic relation Sikhs Hindus states Zaehner both religious thought and their communities and virtually all Sikhs ancestors were Hindus Marriages between Sikhs and Hindus particularly among Khatris were frequent Some Hindu families brought son Sikh and some Hindus view Sikhism tradition within Hinduism even though the Sikh faith distinct religion Julius Lipner states that the custom distinguishing between Hindus Buddhists Jains and Sikhs modern phenomena but one that convenient abstraction Distinguishing Indian traditions fairly recent practice states Lipner and the result not only Western preconceptions about the nature religion general and religion India particular but also with the political awareness that has arisen India its people and result Western influence during its colonial history Scholars such Fleming and Eck state that the postEpic era literature from the 1st millennium amply demonstrate that there was historic concept the Indian subcontinent sacred geography where the sacredness was shared set religious ideas For example the twelve Jyotirlingas Shaivism and fiftyone Shaktipithas Shaktism are described the early medieval era Puranas pilgrimage sites around theme This sacred geography and Shaiva temples with same iconography shared themes motifs and embedded legends are found across India from the Himalayas hills South India from Ellora Caves Varanasi about the middle 1st millennium Shakti temples dated few centuries later are verifiable across the subcontinent Varanasi sacred pilgrimage site documented the Varanasimahatmya text embedded inside the Skanda Purana and the oldest versions this text are dated 6th 8thcentury The idea twelve sacred sites Shiva Hindu tradition spread across the Indian subcontinent appears not only the medieval era temples but also copper plate inscriptions and temple seals discovered different sites According Bhardwaj nonHindu texts such the memoirs Chinese Buddhist and Persian Muslim travellers attest the existence and significance the pilgrimage sacred geography among Hindus later 1st millennium According Fleming those who question whether the term Hindu and Hinduism are modern construction religious context present their arguments based some texts that have survived into the modern era either Islamic courts literature published Western missionaries colonialera Indologists aiming for reasonable construction history However the existence nontextual evidence such cave temples separated thousands kilometers well lists medieval era pilgrimage sites evidence shared sacred geography and existence community that was selfaware shared religious premises and landscape Further norm evolving cultures that there gap between the lived and historical realities religious tradition and the emergence related textual authorities The tradition and temples likely existed well before the medieval era Hindu manuscripts appeared that describe them and the sacred geography This states Fleming apparent given the sophistication the architecture and the sacred sites along with the variance the versions the Puranic literature According Diana Eck and other Indologists such Andr Wink Muslim invaders were aware Hindu sacred geography such Mathura Ujjain and Varanasi the 11thcentury These sites became target their serial attacks the centuries that followed The Hindus have been persecuted during the medieval and modern era The medieval persecution included waves plunder killing destruction temples and enslavement TurkMongol Muslim armies from central Asia This documented Islamic literature such those relating 8th century Muhammad binQasim 11th century Mahmud Ghazni the Persian traveler Biruni the 14th century Islamic army invasion led Timur and various Sunni Islamic rulers the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire There were occasional exceptions such Akbar who stopped the persecution Hindus and occasional severe persecution such under Aurangzeb who destroyed temples forcibly converted nonMuslims Islam and banned the celebration Hindu festivals such Holi and Diwali Other recorded persecution Hindus include those under the reign 18th

Hindus identity being inferior and superstitious contributed Hindus reasserting their spiritual heritage and counter cross examining Islam and Christianity forming organisations such the Hindu Sabhas Hindu associations and ultimately Hinduidentity driven nationalism the 1920s The colonial era Hindu revivalism and mobilisation along with Hindu nationalism states Peter van der Veer was primarily reaction and competition with Muslim separatism and Muslim nationalism The successes each side fed the fears the other leading the growth Hindu nationalism and Muslim nationalism the Indian
