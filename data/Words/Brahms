TwardowskiConrat Brahms maintained classical sense form and order his works contrast the opulence the music many his contemporaries Thus many admirers though not necessarily Brahms himself saw him the champion traditional forms and pure music opposed the New German embrace programme music Brahms venerated Beethoven the composers home marble bust Beethoven looked down the spot where composed and some passages his works are reminiscent Beethovens style Brahmss First Symphony bears strongly the influence Beethovens Fifth Symphony the two works are both Cminor and end the struggle towards Cmajor triumph The main theme the finale the First Symphony also reminiscent the main theme the finale Beethovens Ninth and when this resemblance was pointed out Brahms replied that any dunce could see that 1876 when the work was premiered Vienna was immediately hailed Beethovens Tenth Indeed the similarity Brahmss music that late Beethoven had first been noted early November 1853 letter from Albert Dietrich Ernst Naumann Brahms was master counterpoint For Brahms the most complicated forms counterpoint were natural means expressing his emotions writes Geiringer Palestrina Bach succeeded giving spiritual significance their technique Brahms could turn canon motu contrario canon per augmentationem into pure piece lyrical poetry Writers Brahms have commented his use counterpoint For example Variations Theme Robert Schumann Geiringer writes that Brahms displays all the resources contrapuntal art the Major piano quartet Opus Swafford notes that the third movement demoniccanonic echoing Haydns famous minuet for string quartet called the Witchs Round Swafford further opines that thematic development counterpoint and form were the dominant technical terms which Brahms thought about music Allied his skill counterpoint was Brahmss subtle handling rhythm and meter The New Grove Dictionary Music speculates that the teenage Brahmss contact with Hungarian and gypsy folk music led his lifelong fascination with the irregular rhythms triplet figures and use rubato his compositions The Hungarian Dances are among Brahms mostappreciated pieces According Michael Musgrave 1985 p269 only one composer rivals him the advanced nature his rhythmic thinking and that Stravinsky Brahmss consummate skills counterpoint and rhythm are richly present German Requiem work that was partially inspired his mothers death 1865 which time composed funeral march that was become the basis Part Two Denn alles Fleisch but which also incorporates material from symphony which started 1854 but abandoned following Schumanns suicide attempt once wrote that the Requiem belonged Schumann The first movement this abandoned symphony was reworked the first movement the First Piano Concerto Brahms loved the classical composers Mozart and Haydn collected first editions and autographs their works and edited performing editions studied the music preclassical composers including Giovanni Gabrieli Johann Adolph Hasse Heinrich Schtz Domenico Scarlatti George Frideric Handel and especially Johann Sebastian Bach His friends included leading musicologists and with Friedrich Chrysander edited edition the works Franois Couperin Brahms also edited works CPE Bach and Bach looked older music for inspiration the art counterpoint the themes some his works are modelled Baroque sources such Bachs The Art Fugue the fugal finale Cello Sonata the same composers Cantata 150 the passacaglia theme the Fourth Symphonys finale Peter Phillips 2007 hears affinities between Brahms rhythmically charged contrapuntal textures and those Renaissance masters such Giovanni Gabrieli and William Byrd Referring Byrds Though Amaryllis dance Philips remarks that the crossrhythms this piece excited Fellowes that likened them Brahmss compositional style The early Romantic composers had major influence Brahms particularly Schumann who encouraged Brahms young composer During his stay Vienna 186263 Brahms became particularly interested the music Franz Schubert The latters influence may identified works Brahms dating from the period such the two piano quartets Op25 and Op26 and the Piano Quintet which alludes Schuberts String Quintet and Grand Duo for piano four hands The influence Chopin and Mendelssohn Brahms less obvious although occasionally one can find his works what seems allusion one theirs for example Brahmss Scherzo Op4 alludes Chopins Scherzo Bflat minor the scherzo movement Brahmss Piano Sonata minor Op5 alludes the finale Mendelssohns Piano Trio minor Brahms considered giving composition when seemed that other composers innovations extended tonality resulted the rule tonality being broken altogether Although Wagner became fiercely critical Brahms the latter grew stature and popularity was enthusiastically receptive the early Variations and Fugue Theme Handel Brahms himself according many sources deeply admired Wagners music confining his ambivalence only the dramaturgical precepts Wagners theory Brahms wrote settings for piano and voice 144 German folk songs and many his lieder reflect folk themes depict scenes rural life Brahms wrote number major works for orchestra including two Serenades four symphonies two piano concertos minor Bflat major Violin Concerto Double Concerto for violin and cello and two companion orchestral overtures the Academic Festival Overture and the Tragic Overture His large choral work German Requiem not setting the liturgical Missa pro defunctis but setting texts which Brahms selected from the Luther Bible The work was composed three major periods his life early version the second movement was first composed 1854 not long after Robert Schumanns attempted suicide and this was later used his first piano concerto The majority the Requiem was composed after his mothers death 1865 The fifth movement was added after the official premiere 1868 and the work was published 1869 Brahmss works variation form include among others the Variations and Fugue Theme Handel and the Paganini Variations both for solo piano and the Variations Theme Haydn now sometimes called the Saint Anthony Variations versions for two pianos and for orchestra The final movement the Fourth Symphony Op98 formally passacaglia His chamber works include three string quartets two string quintets two string sextets clarinet quintet clarinet trio horn trio piano quintet three piano quartets and four piano trios the fourth being published posthumously composed several instrumental sonatas with piano including three for violin two for cello and two for clarinet which were subsequently arranged for viola the composer His solo piano works range from his early piano sonatas and ballades his late sets character pieces Brahms was significant Lieder composer who wrote over 200 them His chorale preludes for organ Op122 which wrote shortly before his death have become important part the organ repertoire They were published posthumously 1902 The last this set setting the chorale Welt ich muss dich lassen world now must leave thee and were the last notes wrote often not acknowledged that Brahms along with Robert and Clara Schumann Mendelssohn Liszt and Bruckner were all organists Brahms was extreme perfectionist destroyed many early works including violin sonata had performed with Remnyi and violinist Ferdinand David and once claimed have destroyed string quartets before issued his official First 1873 Over the course several years changed original project for symphony minor into his first piano concerto another instance devotion detail laboured over the official First Symphony for almost fifteen years from about 1861 1876 Even after its first few performances Brahms destroyed the original slow movement and substituted another before the score was published conjectural restoration the original slow movement has been published Robert Pascallcitation needed Another factor that contributed Brahmss perfectionism was Schumanns early enthusiasm which Brahms was determined live Schumanns early approbation was challenge the composers selfconfidence and may have contributed the delay producing the First Symphonyoriginal research Brahms strongly preferred writing absolute music that does not refer explicit scene narrative and never wrote opera symphonic poem Despite his mastery large complex musical structures some Brahmss most popular compositions during his lifetime were smallscale works that were readily accessible the contemporary market for domestic musicmaking Among these lighter works Brahms are his sets popular dances the Hungarian Dances the Waltzes for piano duet Op39 and the Liebeslieder Walzer 52citation needed Brahmss point view looked both backward and forward his output was often bold its exploration harmony and rhythm result was influence composers both conservative and modernist tendencies Within his lifetime his idiom left imprint several composers within his personal circle who strongly admired his music such Heinrich von Herzogenberg Robert Fuchs and Julius Rntgen well Gustav Jenner who was Brahmss only formal composition pupil Antonn Dvok who received substantial assistance from Brahms deeply admired his music and was influenced several works such the Symphony minor and the minor Piano Trio Features the Brahms style were absorbed more complex synthesis with other contemporary chiefly Wagnerian trends Hans Rott Wilhelm Berger Max Reger and Franz Schmidt whereas the British composers Hubert Parry and Edward Elgar and the Swede Wilhelm Stenhammar all testified learning much from Brahmss example Elgar said look the Third Symphony Brahms and feel like pygmy Ferruccio Busonis early music shows much Brahmsian influence and Brahms took interest him though Busoni later tended disparage Brahms Towards the end his life Brahms offered substantial encouragement Ern Dohnnyi and Alexander von Zemlinsky Their early chamber works and those Bla Bartk who was friendly with Dohnnyi show thoroughgoing absorption the Brahmsian idiom Zemlinsky moreover was turn the teacher Arnold Schoenberg and Brahms was apparently impressed drafts two movements Schoenbergs early Quartet major which Zemlinsky showed him 1897 1933 Schoenberg wrote essay Brahms the Progressive rewritten 1947 which drew attention Brahmss fondness for motivic saturation and irregularities rhythm and phrase his last book Structural Functions Harmony 1948 analysed Brahmss enriched harmony and exploration remote tonal regions These efforts paved the way for reevaluation Brahmss reputation the 20th century Schoenberg went far orchestrate one Brahmss piano quartets Schoenbergs pupil Anton Webern his 1933 lectures posthumously published under the title The Path the New Music claimed Brahms one who had anticipated the developments the Second Viennese School and Weberns own Op1 orchestral passacaglia clearly part homage and development the variation techniques the passacagliafinale Brahmss Fourth Symphony Ann Scott has shown how Brahms anticipated the procedures the serialists redistributing melodic fragments between instruments the first movement the Clarinet Sonata Op120 Brahms was honoured the German hall fame the Walhalla memorial September 2000 was introduced there the 126th rhmlich ausgezeichneter Teutscher and 13th composer among them with bust sculptor Milan Knoblochde Brahms has been described agnostic and humanist The devout Catholic Antonn Dvok wrote letter Such man such fine soul and believes nothing believes nothing When asked conductor Karl Reinthaler add additional explicitly religious text his German Requiem Brahms reported have responded far the text concerned confess that would gladly omit even the word German and instead use Human also with best knowledge and will would dispense with passages like John 316 the other hand have chosen one thing another because musician because needed and because
