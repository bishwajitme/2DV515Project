spectrum plural spectra spectrums condition that not limited specific set values but can vary without steps across continuum The word was first used scientifically optics describe the rainbow colors visible light after passing through prism scientific understanding light advanced came apply the entire electromagnetic spectrum Spectrum has since been applied analogy topics outside optics Thus one might talk about the spectrum political opinion the spectrum activity drug the autism spectrum these uses values within spectrum may not associated with precisely quantifiable numbers definitions Such uses imply broad range conditions behaviors grouped together and studied under single title for ease discussion Nonscientific uses the term spectrum are sometimes misleading For instance single leftright spectrum political opinion does not capture the full range peoples political beliefs Political scientists use variety biaxial and multiaxial systems more accurately characterize political opinion most modern usages spectrum there unifying theme between the extremes either end This was not always true older usage Latin spectrum means image apparition including the meaning spectre Spectral evidence testimony about what was done spectres persons not present physically hearsay evidence about what ghosts apparitions Satan said was used convict number persons witchcraft Salem Massachusetts the late 17th century The word spectrum Spektrum was strictly used designate ghostly optical afterimage Goethe his Theory Colors and Schopenhauer Vision and Colors The prefix spectro used form words relating spectra For example spectrometer device used record spectra and spectroscopy the use spectrometer for chemical analysis the 17th century the word spectrum was introduced into optics Isaac Newton referring the range colors observed when white light was dispersed through prism Soon the term referred plot light intensity power function frequency wavelength also known spectral density plot The term spectrum was expanded apply other waves such sound waves that could also measured function frequency frequency spectrum and power spectrum signal The term now applies any signal that can measured decomposed along continuous variable such energy electron spectroscopy masstocharge ratio mass spectrometry Spectrum also used refer graphical representation the signal function the dependent variable Electromagnetic spectrum refers the full range all frequencies electromagnetic radiation and also the characteristic distribution electromagnetic radiation emitted absorbed that particular object Devices used measure electromagnetic spectrum are called spectrograph spectrometer The visible spectrum the part the electromagnetic spectrum that can seen the human eye The wavelength visible light ranges from 390 700nm The absorption spectrum chemical element chemical compound the spectrum frequencies wavelengths incident radiation that are absorbed the compound due electron transitions from lower higher energy state The emission spectrum refers the spectrum radiation emitted the compound due electron transitions from higher lower energy state Light from many different sources contains various colors each with its own brightness intensity rainbow prism sends these component colors different directions making them individually visible different angles graph the intensity plotted against the frequency showing the brightness each color the frequency spectrum the light When all the visible frequencies are present equally the perceived color the light white and the spectrum flat line Therefore flatline spectra general are often referred white whether they represent light another type wave phenomenon sound for example vibration structure radio and telecommunications the frequency spectrum can shared among many different broadcasters The radio spectrum the part the electromagnetic spectrum corresponding frequencies lower below 300GHz which corresponds wavelengths longer than about 1mm The microwave spectrum corresponds frequencies between 300MHz 03GHz and 300GHz and wavelengths between one meter and one millimeter Each broadcast radio and station transmits wave assigned frequency range called channel When many broadcasters are present the radio spectrum consists the sum all the individual channels each carrying separate information spread across wide frequency spectrum Any particular radio receiver will detect single function amplitude voltage time The radio then uses tuned circuit tuner select single channel frequency band and demodulate decode the information from that broadcaster made graph the strength each channel the frequency the tuner would the frequency spectrum the antenna signal astronomical spectroscopy the strength shape and position absorption and emission lines well the overall spectral energy distribution the continuum reveal many properties astronomical objects Stellar classification the categorisation stars based their characteristic electromagnetic spectra The spectral flux density used represent the spectrum lightsource such star radiometry and colorimetry color science more generally the spectral power distribution SPD light source measure the power contributed each frequency color light source The light spectrum usually measured points often along the visible spectrum wavelength space instead frequency space which makes not strictly spectral density Some spectrophotometers can measure increments fine one two nanometers the values are used calculate other specifications and then plotted show the spectral attributes the source This can helpful analyzing the color characteristics particular source plot ion abundance function masstocharge ratio called mass spectrum can produced mass spectrometer instrument The mass spectrum can used determine the quantity and mass atoms and molecules Tandem mass spectrometry used determine molecular structure physics the energy spectrum particle the number particles intensity particle beam function particle energy Examples techniques that produce energy spectrum are alphaparticle spectroscopy electron energy loss spectroscopy and massanalyzed ionkineticenergy spectrometry physics particularly quantum mechanics some differential operators have discrete spectra with gaps between values Common cases include the Hamiltonian and the angular momentum operator acoustics spectrogram visual representation the frequency spectrum sound function time another variable source sound can have many different frequencies mixed Musical tones timbre characterized its harmonic spectrum Sound our environment that refer noise includes many different frequencies When sound signal contains mixture all audible frequencies distributed equally over the audio spectrum called white noise The spectrum analyzer instrument which can used convert the sound wave the musical note into visual display the constituent frequencies This visual display referred acoustic spectrogram Software based audio spectrum analyzers are available low cost providing easy access not only industry professionals but also academics students and the hobbyist The acoustic spectrogram generated the spectrum analyzer provides acoustic signature the musical note addition revealing the fundamental frequency and its overtones the spectrogram also useful for analysis the temporal attack decay sustain and release the musical note Antibiotic spectrum activity component antibiotic classification broadspectrum antibiotic active against wide range bacteria whereas narrowspectrum antibiotic effective against specific families bacteria example commonly used broadspectrum antibiotic ampicillin example narrow spectrum antibiotic Dicloxacillin which acts betalactamaseproducing Grampositive bacteria such Staphylococcus aureus psychiatry the spectrum approach uses the term spectrum describe range linked conditions sometimes also extending include singular symptoms and traits For example the autism spectrum describes range conditions classified neurodevelopmental disorders mathematics the spectrum matrix the multiset the eigenvalues the matrix functional analysis the concept the spectrum bounded operator generalization the eigenvalue concept for matrices algebraic topology spectrum object representing generalized cohomology theory social science economic spectrum used indicate the range social class along some indicator wealth income political science the term political spectrum refers system classifying political positions one more dimensions for example range including right wing and left wing
