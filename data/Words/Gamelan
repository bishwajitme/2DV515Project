set instruments each tuning and classically only one tuning used time The precise tuning used differs from ensemble ensemble and gives each ensemble its own particular flavour set gamelan instruments will tuned the same set notes but the tuning will vary from one gamelan the next including variations the size intervals Colin McPhee Canadian composer who spent much time Bali remarked Deviations what considered the same scale are large that one might with reason state that there are many scales there are gamelans This view contested however some teachers gamelan and there have been efforts combine multiple ensembles and tuning structures into one gamelan ease transportation festival time One such ensemble gamelan Manikasanti which can play the repertoire many different ensembles Balinese gamelan instruments are built pairs that are tuned slightly apart produce interference beats ideally consistent speed for all pairs notes all registers This concept referred ombak translating

notes higher pitch the balungan melodic framework and horizontal lines which represent the series beats read downward with time The fourth vertical line and every fourth horizontal line completing gatra are darkened for legibility Symbols the left indicate the colotomic metric structure gongs and forth while specific drum features are notated symbols the right The Solonese notation reads horizontally like Western notation but does not use barlines Instead note values and rests are squiggled between the notes Today this notation relatively rare and has been replaced kepatihan notation which cipher system Kepatihan notation developed around 1900 the kepatihan Palace Surakarta which had become highschool conservatory The pitches are numbered see the articles the scales slendro and plog for explanation how and are read across with dots below above the numbers indicating the register and lines above notes showing time values vocal notation there are also brackets under groups
