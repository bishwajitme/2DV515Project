fortepiano early piano principle the word fortepiano can designate any piano dating from the invention the instrument Bartolomeo Cristofori around 1700 the early 19th century Most typically however used refer the late18th early19th century instruments for which Haydn Mozart and the younger Beethoven wrote their piano music Starting Beethovens time the fortepiano began period steady evolution culminating the late 19th century with the modern grand The earlier fortepiano became obsolete and was absent from the musical scene for many decades the 20th century the fortepiano was revived following the rise interest historically informed performance Fortepianos are built for this purpose today specialist workshops The fortepiano has leathercovered hammers and thin harpsichordlike strings has much lighter case construction than the modern piano and except for later examples the early nineteenth century already evolving towards the modern piano has metal frame bracing The action and hammers are lighter giving rise much lighter touch which wellconstructed fortepianos also very responsive The range the fortepiano was about four octaves the time its invention and gradually increased Mozart 17561791 wrote his piano music for instruments about five octaves The piano works Beethoven 17701827 reflect gradually expanding range his last piano compositions are for instrument about six and half octaves The range most modern pianos attained the 19th century octaves Fortepianos from the start often had devices similar the pedals modern pianos but these were not always pedals sometimes hand stops knee levers were used instead Like the modern piano the fortepiano can vary the sound volume each note depending the players touch The tone the fortepiano quite different from that the modern piano however being softer with less sustain Sforzando accents tend stand out more than the modern piano they differ from softer notes timbre well volume and decay rapidly Fortepianos also tend have quite different tone quality their different registers slightly buzzing the bass tinkling the high treble and more rounded closest the modern piano the mid range comparison modern pianos are rather more uniform sound through their range The piano was invented harpsichord maker Bartolomeo Cristofori Florence around the turn the 18th century The first reliable record piano appears the inventory the Medici family who were Cristoforis patrons dated 1700 Cristofori continued develop the instrument until the 1720s the time from which the surviving three Cristofori instruments date Cristofori perhaps best admired today for his ingenious piano action which some ways was more subtle and effective than that many later instruments However other innovations were also needed make the piano possible Merely attaching the Cristofori action harpsichord would have produced very weak tone Cristoforis instruments instead used thicker tenser strings mounted frame considerably more robust than that contemporary harpsichords with virtually all later pianos Cristoforis instruments the hammers struck more than one string time Cristofori used pairs strings throughout the range Cristofori was also the first incorporate form soft pedal into piano the mechanism which the hammers are made strike fewer than the maximum number strings Cristoforis was hand stop not clear whether the modern soft pedal descends directly from Cristoforis work arose independently Cristoforis invention soon attracted public attention the result journal article written Scipione Maffei and published 1711 Giornale deletterati dItalia Venice The article included diagram the action the core Cristoforis invention This article was republished 1719 volume Maffeis work and then German translation 1725 Johann Matthesons Critica Musica The latter publication was perhaps the triggering event the spread the fortepiano Germanspeaking countries see below Cristoforis instrument spread first quite slowly probably because being more elaborate and harder build than harpsichord was very expensive For time the piano was the instrument royalty with Cristoforibuilt styled instruments played the courts Portugal and Spain Several were owned Queen Maria Barbara Spain who was the pupil the composer Domenico Scarlatti One the first private individuals own piano was the castrato Farinelli who inherited one from Maria Barbara her death The first music specifically written for piano dates from this period the Sonate cimbalo piano 1732 Lodovico Giustini This publication was isolated phenomenon James Parakilas conjectures that the publication was meant honor for the composer the part his royal patrons Certainly there could have been commercial market for fortepiano music while the instrument continued exotic specimen appears that the fortepiano did not achieve full popularity until the 1760s from which time the first records public performances the instrument are dated and when music described being for the fortepiano was first widely published was Gottfried Silbermann who brought the construction fortepianos the Germanspeaking nations Silbermann who worked Freiberg Germany began make pianos based Cristoforis design around 1730 His previous experience had been building organs harpsichords and clavichords Like Cristofori Silbermann had royal support his case from Frederick the Great Prussia who bought many his instruments Silbermanns instruments were famously criticized Johann Sebastian Bach around 1736 but later instruments encountered Bach his Berlin visit 1747 apparently met with the composers approval has been conjectured that the improvement Silbermanns instruments resulted from his having seen actual Cristofori piano rather than merely reading Scipione Maffeis article The piano action Maffei described does not match that found surviving Cristofori instruments suggesting that Maffei either erred his diagram admitted having made from memory that Cristofori improved his action during the period following Maffeis articleoriginal research Silbermann credited with the invention the forerunner the sustain pedal which removes the dampers from all the strings once permitting them vibrate freely Silbermanns device was fact only hand stop and thus could changed only pause the music Throughout the Classical era even when the more flexible knee levers pedals had been installed the lifting all the dampers was used primarily coloristic devicecitation needed The fortepiano builders who followed Silbermann introduced actions that were simpler than the Cristofori action even the point lacking escapement the device that permits the hammer fall rest position even when the key has been depressed Such instruments were the subject criticism particularly widely quoted 1777 letter from Mozart his father but were simple make and were widely incorporated into square pianos One the most distinguished fortepiano builders the era following Silbermann was one his pupils Johann Andreas Stein who worked Augsburg Germany Steins fortepianos had what Cristofori would call backwards hammers with the striking end closer the player than the hinged end This action came called the Viennese action and was widely used Vienna even pianos the mid 19th century The Viennese action was simpler than the Cristofori action and very sensitive the players touch According Edwin Ripin see references below the force needed depress key Viennese fortepiano was only about fourth what modern piano and the descent the key only about half much Thus playing the Viennese fortepiano involved nothing like the athleticism exercised modern piano virtuosos but did require exquisite sensitivity touch Stein put the wood used his instruments through very severe weathering process and this included the generation cracks the wood into which would then insert wedges This gave his instruments considerable longevity which Mozart commented and there are several instruments still surviving today Steins fortepiano business was carried Vienna with distinction his daughter Nannette Streicher along with her husband Johann Andreas Streicher The two were friends Beethoven and one the composers pianos was Streicher Later the early 19th century more robust instruments with greater range were built Vienna for example the Streicher firm which continued through two more generations Streichers Another important Viennese builder was Anton Walter friend Mozarts who built instruments with somewhat more powerful sound than Steins Although Mozart admired the Stein fortepianos very much the 1777 letter mentioned above makes clear his own piano was Walter The fortepianos Stein and Walter are widely used today models for the construction new fortepianos discussed below Still another important builder this period was Conrad Graf 17821851 who made Beethovens last piano Graf was one the first Viennese makers build pianos quantity large business enterprise The English fortepiano had humble origin the work Johannes Zumpe maker who had immigrated from Germany and worked for while the workshop the great harpsichord maker Burkat Shudi Starting the middle late 1760s Zumpe made inexpensive square pianos that had very simple action lacking escapement sometimes known the old mans head Although hardly technological advancement the fortepiano Zumpes instruments proved very popular they were imitated outside England and played major role the displacement the harpsichord the fortepiano These square pianos were also the medium the first public performances the instrument the 1760s notably Johann Christian Bach Americus Backers with John Broadwood and Robert Stodart two Shudis workmen produced more advanced action than Zumpes This English grand action with escapement and check enabled louder more robust sound than the Viennese one though required deeper touch and was less sensitive The early English grand pianos these builders physically resembled Shudi harpsichords which say very imposing with elegant restrained veneer work the exterior Unlike contemporary Viennese instruments English grand fortepianos had three strings rather than two per note John Broadwood married the masters daughter Barbara Shudi 1769 and ultimately took over and renamed the Shudi firm The Broadwood company which survives this day was important innovator the evolution the fortepiano into the piano Broadwood collaboration with Jan Ladislav Dussek noted piano virtuoso active London the 1790s developed pianos that gradually increased the range six octaves Dussek was one the first pianists receive foot piano and 1793 wrote the first work for piano with extra keys piano concert The firm shipped piano Beethoven Vienna which the composer evidently treasured From the late 18th century the fortepiano underwent extensive technological development and thus evolved into the modern piano for details see Piano The older type instrument ceased made the late 19th century the early music pioneer Arnold Dolmetsch built three fortepianos However this attempted revival the fortepiano was evidently several decades ahead its time and did not lead widespread adoption the instrumentcitation needed the second half the 20th century great upsurge interest occurred period instruments including revival interest the fortepiano Old instruments were restored and many new ones were built along the lines the old This revival the fortepiano closely resembled the revival the harpsichord though occurring somewhat later time Among the more prominent modern builders have been the United States Philip Belt Margaret Hood and Rodney Regier and the Czech Republic Paul McNulty The reintroduction the fortepiano has permitted performance 18th and early 19thcentury music the instruments for which was written yielding new insights into this music for detailed discussion see Piano

Peter Serkin Viviana Sofronitsky Andreas Staier and Melvyn Tan Peoples opinions about fortepiano sound vary widely both from person person and from instrument instrument Here are three representative opinions about fortepianos Fortepiano Italian for loudsoft just the formal name for the modern piano pianoforte softloud Both are abbreviations Cristoforis original name for his invention gravicembalo col piano forte harpsichord with soft and loud The term fortepiano somewhat specialist its connotations and does not preclude using the more general term piano designate the same instrument Thus usages like Cristofori invented the piano Mozarts piano concertos are currently common and would probably considered acceptable most musicians Fortepiano used contexts where important make the precise identity the instrument clear for instance fortepiano recital Malcolm Bilson The use fortepiano refer specifically early pianos appears recent Even the authoritative Oxford English Dictionary does not record this usage noting only that fortepiano early name the pianoforte During the age the fortepiano fortepiano and pianoforte were used interchangeably the OEDs attestations show Jane Austen who lived the age the fortepiano used pianoforte also pianoforte piano forte for the many occurrences the instrument her writings
