Old High German OHG German Althochdeutsch German abbr Ahd the earliest stage the German language conventionally covering the period from around 700 1050 Coherent written texts not appear until the second half the 8th century and some treat the period before 750 prehistoric including the ProtoGermanic language and date the start Old High German proper 750 for this reason There are however number Elder Futhark inscriptions dating the 6th century notably the Pforzen buckle well single words and many names found Latin texts predating the 8th century During the Migration Period the High Germanspeaking tribes settled what became Alamannia the Duchy Bavaria and the Kingdom the Lombards the same time the Franconianspeaking tribes settled the area between those two riversclarification needed before crossing the Rhine conquer Northern Gaul where under the Merovingians they created the Frankish kingdom Francia which eventually stretched down the Loire Old High German comprises the dialects these groups which underwent the Second Sound Shift during the 6th Century namely all Elbe Germanic and most the WeserRhine Germanic dialects The Franks the western part Francia Neustria and western Austrasia gradually adopted GalloRomance the beginning the OHG period with the linguistic boundary later stabilised approximately along the course the Meuse and Moselle the east and the northern boundary probably little further south than the current boundary between French and Flemish North this line the Franks retained their language but was not affected the Second Sound Shift which thus separated their Low Franconian variety the ancestor Dutch from the more easterly Franconian dialects which formed part Old High German The Saxons and the Frisians along the shores North Sea were likewise not affected the Second Sound Shift and bundle isoglosses similar location the modern Benrath line marked the Northern limit the sound shift and separated the dialect the Franks from Old Saxon the south the Lombards who had settled Northern Italy maintained their dialect until their conquest Charlemagne 774 After this the Germanicspeaking population who were then almost certainly bilingual gradually switched the Romance language the native population that Langobardic had died out the end the OHG period the beginning the period Germanic language was spoken east line from Kieler Frde the rivers Elbe and Saale earlier Germanic speakers the Northern part the area having been displaced the Slavs This area did not become Germanspeaking again until the German eastward expansion Ostkolonisation the early 12th century though there was some attempt conquest and missionary work under the Ottonians The Alemannic polity was conquered Clovis 496 and the last twenty years the 8th century Charlemagne subdued the Saxons the Frisians the Bavarians and the Lombards bringing all continental Germanicspeaking peoples under Frankish rule While this led some degree Frankish linguistic influence the language both the administration and the Church was Latin and this unification did not therefore lead any development supraregional variety Frankish nor standardized Old High German the individual dialects retained their identity Old High German literacy product the monasteries notably Gallen Reichenau Island and Fulda Its origins lie the establishment the German church Saint Boniface the mid 8th century and was further encouraged during the Carolingian Renaissance the 9th The dedication the preservation Old High German epic poetry among the scholars the Carolingian Renaissance was significantly greater than could suspected from the meagre survivals have today less than 200 lines total between the Hildebrandslied and the Muspilli Einhard tells how Charlemagne himself ordered that the epic lays should collected for posterity was the neglect religious zeal later generations that led the loss these records Thus was Charlemagnes weak successor Louis the Pious who destroyed his fathers collection epic poetry account its pagan content Rabanus Maurus student Alcuins and abbot Fulda from 822 was important advocate the cultivation German literacy Among his students were Walafrid Strabo and Otfrid Weissenburg Towards the end the Old High German period Notker Labeo 1022 was among the greatest stylists the language and developed systematic orthography The main difference between Old High German and the West Germanic dialects from which developed that underwent the High German consonant shift also called the second consonant shift relation the similar but much earlier Grimms law This generally dated approximately the late 5th and early 6th centurieshence dating its start around 500 The result this sound change that the consonantal system German remains different from all other West Germanic languages including English and Low German Grammatically however Old High German remained very similar Old English Old Dutch and Old Saxon the mid 11th century the many different vowels found unstressed syllables had all been reduced Since these vowels were part the grammatical endings the nouns and verbs their loss led radical simplification the inflectional grammar German For these reasons 1050 seen the start the Middle High German period though fact there are almost texts German for the next hundred years Examples vowel reduction unstressed syllables the Modern German forms these words are broadly the same Middle High German There was standard supraregional variety Old High Germanevery text written particular dialect some cases mixture dialects Broadly speaking the main dialect divisions Old High German seem have been similar those later periodsthey are based established territorial groupings and the effects the Second Sound Shift which have remained influential until the present day But because the direct evidence for Old High German consists solely manuscripts produced few major ecclesiastical centres there isogloss information the sort which modern dialect maps are based For this reason the dialects may termed monastery dialects German Klosterdialekte The main dialects with their bishoprics and monasteries addition there are two poorly attested dialects The continued existence West Frankish dialect the Western Romanized part Francia uncertain Claims that this might have been the language the Carolingian court that attested the Ludwigslied whose presence French manuscript suggests bilingualism are controversial The charts show the vowel and consonant systems the East Franconian dialect the 9th century This the dialect the monastery Fulda and specifically the Old High German Tatian Dictionaries and grammars OHG often use the spellings the Tatian substitute for genuine standardised spellings and these have the advantage being recognizably close the Middle High German forms words particularly with respect the consonants Old High German had five phonemic long vowels and six phonemic short vowels Both occurred stressed and unstressed syllables Notes Old High German diphthongs are indicated the digraphs Here are enumerated the sound changes that transformed Common West Germanic into Old High German not including the Late OHG changes which effected Middle High German Germanic had simple twotense system with forms for present and preterite These were inherited Old High German but addition OHG developed three periphrastic tenses the perfect pluperfect and future The periphrastic past tenses were formed combining the present preterite auxiliary verb wsan habn with the past participle Initially the past participle retained its original function adjective and showed case and gender endings for intransitive verbs the nominative for transitive verbs the accusative For example After thie argangana warun ahtu taga Tatian 71When eight days had passed literally After that then passed away were eight daysLatin postquam consummati sunt dies octo Luke 221 phgboum habeta sum giflanzotan Tatian 1022someone had planted fig tree literally figtree had certain someone plantedLatin arborem fici habebat quidam plantatam Luke time however these endings fell out use and the participle came seen longer adjective but part the verb Modern German This development generally taken the result need translate Latin forms but parallels other Germanic languages particularly Gothic where the Biblical texts were translated from Greek not Latin raise the possibility that was independent development Germanic also had future tense but again OHG created periphrastic forms using auxiliary verb skulan Modern German sollen and the infinitive werden and the present participle Thu scalt beran einan alawaltenden Otfrids Evangelienbuch I523You will bear almighty oneInti uuirdist thu suigenti Tatian 29And now you will start fall silentLatin ecce eris tacens Luke 120 The present tense continued used alongside these new forms indicate future time still Modern German The following sample conjugation strong verb nman take The early part the period saw considerable missionary activity and 800 the whole the Frankish Empire had principle been Christianized All the manuscripts which contain Old High German texts were written ecclesiastical scriptoria scribes whose main task was writing Latin rather than German Consequently the majority Old High German texts are religious nature and show strong influence ecclesiastical Latin the vocabulary fact most surviving prose texts are translations Latin originals Even secular works such the Hildebrandslied are often preserved only because they were written spare sheets religious codices The earliest Old High German text generally taken the Abrogans LatinOld High German glossary variously dated between 750 and 780 probably from Reichenau The 8th century Merseburg Incantations are the only remnant preChristian German literature The earliest texts not dependent Latin originals would seem the Hildebrandslied and the Wessobrunn Prayer both recorded manuscripts the early 9th century though the texts are assumed derive from earlier copies The Bavarian Muspilli the sole survivor what must have been vast oral tradition Other important works are the Evangelienbuch Gospel harmony Otfrid von Weissenburg the short but splendid Ludwigslied and the 9th century Georgslied The boundary Early Middle High German from c1050 not clearcut example Early Middle High German literature the Annolied The Lords Prayer given four Old High German dialects below Because these are translations liturgical text they are best not regarded examples idiomatic language but they show dialect variation very clearly Pater noster qui caelis essanctificetur nomen tuumadveniat regnum tuumfiat voluntas tuasicut caelo terrapanem
