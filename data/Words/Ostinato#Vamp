propels scenes that lack dynamic visual action Ostinato plays important part improvised music rock and jazz which often referred riff vamp favorite technique contemporary jazz writers ostinati are often used modal and Latin jazz and traditional African music including Gnawa music The term ostinato has essentially the same meaning the medieval Latin word pes the word ground applied classical music and the word riff contemporary popular music Ostinati are used 20thcentury music stabilize groups pitches Stravinskys The Rite Spring Introduction and Augurs Spring famous type ostinato called

Vincenzo Bellini and later Wagner pure instrumental terms discarding the closing vocal cadenza Applicable homophonic and contrapuntal textures they are repetitive rhythmicharmonic schemes more familiar accompanimental melodies purely rhythmic The techniques appeal composers from Debussy avantgarde composers until least the 1970s lies part the need for unity created the virtual abandonment functional chord progressions shape phrases and define tonality Similarly modal music relentless repetitive character help establish and confirm the modal center Their popularity may also justified their ease well range use though ostinato must employed judiciously its overuse can quickly lead monotony Ostinato patterns have been present European music from the Middle Ages onwards the famous English canon Sumer Icumen the main vocal lines are underpinned ostinato pattern known pes Later the medieval era Dufays 15th century chanson Resvelons Nous features similarly constructed ostinato

Copland describes basso ostinato the easiest recognize the variation forms wherein long phraseeither accompanimental figure actual melodyis repeated over and over again the bass part while the upper parts proceed normally with variation However cautions might more properly termed musical device than musical form One striking ostinato instrumental piece the late Renaissance period The Bells piece for virginals William Byrd Here the ostinato ground consists just two notes Italy during the seventeenth century Claudio Monteverdi composed many pieces using ostinato patterns his operas and sacred works One these was his 1650 version Laetatus sum imposing setting Psalm 122 that pits four note ostinato unquenchable energy against both voices and instruments Later the same century Henry Purcell became famous for his skilful deployment ground bass patterns His most famous ostinato the descending chromatic ground bass that underpins the Lament the end his opera Dido and Aeneas While the use descending chromatic scale express pathos was fairly common the end the seventeenth century Richard Taruskin points out that Purcell shows fresh approach this musical trope Altogether unconventional and characteristic however the interpolation additional cadential measure into the stereotyped ground increasing its length from routine four haunting five bars against which the vocal line with its despondent refrain Remember deployed with marked asymmetry That plus Purcells distinctively dissonant suspensionsaturated harmony enhanced additional chromatic descents during the final ritornello and many deceptive cadences makes this little aria unforgettably poignant embodiment heartache See also Lament bassHowever this not the only ostinato pattern that Purcell uses the opera Didos opening aria Belinda further demonstration Purcells technical mastery the phrases the vocal line not always coincide with the 4bar ground Purcells compositions over ground vary their working out and the repetition never becomes restriction Purcells instrumental music also featured ground patterns particularly fine and complex example his Fantasia upon Ground for three violins and continuo The intervals the above pattern are found many works the Baroque Period Pachelbels Canon also uses similar sequence notes the bass part Two pieces JSBach are particularly striking for their use ostinato bass the Crucifixus from his Mass minor and the Passacaglia minor for organ which has ground rich melodic intervals The first variation that Bach builds over this ostinato consists gently syncopated motif the upper voices This characteristic rhythmic pattern continues the second variation but with some engaging harmonic subtleties especially the second bar where unexpected chord creates passing implication related key common with other Passacaglias the era the ostinato not simply confined the bass but rises the uppermost part later the piece performance the entire piece can heard here Ostinatos feature many works the late 18th and early 19th centuries Mozart uses ostinato phrase throughout the big scene that ends Act the Marriage Figaro convey sense suspense the jealous Count Almaviva tries vain

shared between viola and cello supporting melody octaves the first and second violins Beethoven reverses this relationship few bars later with the melody the viola and cello and the ostinato shared between the violins Both the first and third acts Wagners final opera Parsifal feature passage accompanying scene where band Knights solemnly processes from the depths forest the hall the Grail The Transformation music that supports this change scene dominated the iterated tolling four bells Brahms used ostinato patterns both the finale his Fourth Symphony and the closing section his Variations Theme Haydn Debussy featured ostinato pattern throughout his Piano Prelude Des pas sur Neige Here the ostinato pattern stays the middle register the piano never used bass Remark that the footfall ostinato remains nearly throughout the same notes the same pitch level this piece appeal the basic loneliness all human beings oftforgotten perhaps but like the ostinato forming basic undercurrent our history all the major classical composers the Twentieth Century Stravinsky possibly the one most associated with the practice ostinato conversation with the composer his friend and colleague Robert Craft remarked Your music always has element repetition ostinato What the function ostinato Stravinsky replied static that antidevelopment and sometimes need contradiction development Stravinsky was particularly skilled using ostinatos confound rather than confirm rhythmic expectations the first his Three Pieces for String Quartet Stravinsky sets three repeated patterns which overlap one another and never coincide Here rigid pattern 3224 bars laid over strictly recurring twentythreebeat tune the bars being marked cello ostinato that their changing relationship governed primarily the precompositional scheme The rhythmical current running through the music what binds together these curious mosaiclike pieces subtler metrical conflict can found the final section Stravinskys Symphony Psalms The choir sing melody triple time while the bass instruments the orchestra play 4beat ostinato against this This built over ostinato bass harp two pianos and timpani moving fourths like pendulum Many instruments south the Sahara Desert play ostinato melodiesclarification needed These include lamellophones such the mbira well xylophones like the balafon the bikutsi and the gyil Ostinato figures are also played string instruments such the kora gankoqui bell ensembles and pitched drums ensembles Often African ostinatos contain offbeats crossbeats that contradict the metric structure Other African ostinatos generate complete crossrhythms sounding both the main beats and crossbeats the following example gyil sounds the threeagainsttwo crossrhythm hemiola The left hand lower notes sounds the two main beats while the right hand upper notes sounds the three crossbeats Popular dance bands West Africa and the Congo region feature ostinato playing guitars The African guitar parts have drawn from variety sources including the indigenous mbira well foreign influences such James Browntype funk riffs However the foreign influences are interpreted through distinctly African ostinato sensibility African guitar styles began with Congolese bands doing Cuban cover songs The Cuban guajeo had both familiar and exotic quality the African musicians Gradually various regional guitar styles emerged indigenous influences became increasingly dominant within these Africanized guajeos Moore states One could say that chord progressions African music what the 12bar blues North American music Such progressions seem superficially follow the conventions Western music theory However performers African popular music not perceive these progressions the same way Harmonic
