Woodwind instruments are family musical instruments within the more general category wind instruments There are two main types woodwind instruments flutes and reed instruments otherwise called reed pipes What differentiates these instruments from other wind instruments the way which they produce their sound All woodwinds produce sound splitting exhaled air stream sharp edge such reed fipple woodwind may made any material not just wood Common examples include brass silver cane well other metals such gold and platinum Occasionally woodwinds are made out earthen materials especially ocarinas Common examples include flute oboe clarinet bassoon and saxophone Flutes produce sound directing focused stream air below the edge hole cylindrical tube The flute family can divided into two subfamilies open flutes and closed flutes produce sound with open flute the player required blow stream air across sharp edge that then splits the airstream This split airstream then acts upon the air column contained within the flutes hollow causing vibrate and produce sound Examples open flutes are the transverse flute panpipes and shakuhachi Ancient flutes this variety were often made from tubular sections plants such grasses reeds and hollowedout tree branches Later flutes were made metals such tin copper bronze Modern concert flutes are usually made highgrade metal alloys usually containing nickel silver copper gold produce sound with closed flute the player required blow air into duct This duct acts channel bringing the air sharp edge with the open flutes the air then split this causes the column air within the closed flute vibrate and produce sound Examples this type flute include the recorder ocarina and organ pipes Reed instruments produce sound focusing air into mouthpiece which then causes reed reeds vibrate Similar flutes Reed pipes are also further divided into two types single reed and double reed Singlereed woodwinds produce sound placing reed onto the opening mouthpiece using ligature When air forced between the reed and the mouthpiece the reed causes the air column the instrument vibrate and produce its unique sound Single reed instruments include the clarinet saxophone and others such the chalumeau Doublereed instruments use two precisely cut small pieces cane bound together the base This form sound production has been estimated have originated the middle late Neolithic period its discovery has been attributed the observation wind blowing through split rush The finished bound reed inserted into the instrument and vibrates air forced between the two pieces again causing the air within the instrument vibrate well This family reed pipes subdivided further into another two subfamilies exposed double reed and capped double reed instruments Exposed doublereed instruments are played having the double reed directly between the players lips This family includes instruments such the oboe cor anglais also called English horn and bassoon and many types shawms throughout the world the other hand Capped doublereed instruments have the double reed covered cap The player blows through hole this cap that then directs the air through the reeds This family includes the crumhorn Bagpipes are unique reed pipe instruments since they use two more double single reeds However bagpipes are functionally the same capped double reed instruments since the reeds are never direct contact with players lips Free reed aerophone instruments are likewise unique since sound produced free reeds small metal tongues arranged rows within metal wooden frame The airflow necessary for the instruments sound generated either players breath harmonica bellows accordion The modern orchestras woodwind section typically includes flutes oboes clarinets and bassoons The piccolo cor anglais bass clarinet Eflat clarinet and contrabassoon are commonly used supplementary woodwind instruments The section may also occasion expanded the addition saxophones The concert bands woodwind section typically much larger and more diverse than the orchestras The concert bands woodwind section typically includes piccolos flutes oboes clarinets bass clarinets bassoons alto saxophones tenor saxophones and baritone saxophones The cor anglais clarinet alto clarinet contraalto clarinet contrabass clarinet contrabassoon and soprano saxophone are also used but not frequently the other woodwinds
