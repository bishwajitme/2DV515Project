groups officially recognized the Peoples Republic China The official Chinese government classification includes the Mosuo part the Nashi people although neither ethnicity support this categorization Although both groups are descendents the Qiang people together with the Pumi and and notwithstanding very striking resemblances between their respective languages the two groups are now understood culturally distinct the Nakhi more influenced the very patriarchal Han Chinese culture the Mosuo more influenced Tibetan culture and their own matriarchal family practices Nashi culture largely its own native Dongba religious literary and farming practices influenced the Confucian roots Han Chinese history and also the groups Tibetan neighbors Especially the case their musical scores acts the

the presentday province Sichuan western China After being pushed south other conquering tribes the Nashi settled the very fertile Baisha and Lijiang areas the year Nashi histories describe split into three groups while their ancestors were still Baisha The ones who remained are known the Nashi those Dali are known Baicitation needed and those living around the Lugu Lake are called the Mosuo Today this description the origins the Bai and Mosuo strenuously contested Historians have decided that between the tenth and thirteenth centuries agricultural production Lijiang replaced livestock breeding the main occupation the people The production agricultural handicraft mineral and livestock products led considerable prosperity and during this period number slaveowning groups Ninglang Lijiang and Weixi counties developed into feudal caste lords Tibetan Buddhism took hold the Lijiang region following visits from the Karmapas from the fourteenth century onwards 1278 the Yuan Dynasty established the Lijiang Prefecture which represented the imperial court Yunnan chieftain Mude was made the hereditary chieftain Lijiang Prefecture exercising control over the Nashi people and other ethnic groups

Tibetan cultural influences Tibetan Buddhism has gained widespread respect especially the case the Mosuo Taoism and particularly its fengshui practices have been widely practiced since the tenth century Dongba religion was rooted the beliefs the Tibetan religion the word Dongba literally means wise man the Nakhi language Historians have traced origins shaman from eastern Tibet named Dongba Shilo who lived cave near Baishuitai 900 years ago According Nashi legends was said have created the Lijiang Mural Anthropologists claim that many the Dongba rituals show strong influences from the religion and are not native origin lamas are believed have settled among the Nashi farmers and have begun practise exorcisms way earning little money the side they were thus competition with the native ritual specialists locally known Llbu Ssannyi This disputed largely because the Bon religion adulterated Tibetan Buddhism today that difficult find pure and authentic practitioners use basis for comparison Religious scriptures suggest that the Llbu were female shamans who practised divination exorcism and other rites trance the early nineteenth century the Dongba priests had created huge religious vocabulary accompanied variety rituals and had largely displaced the Llbu This certainly the case with shamans but the connection dongba practices remains unclear Adherents Dongba had places worship and they were not officially recognized religion the Communists following their arrival the region Dongba shaman merely parttime practitioner priest who literate Dongba religious texts that were unreadable most Nashi who are not usually taught read their own language The Dongba religion based the relationship between nature and man Dongba mythology Nature and Man are halfbrothers having different mothers According the villagers Shu Ming Village nature controlled spirits called Shv These gods are depicted humansnake chimeras The Dongba priests practice rituals such the Shv appease these spirits and prevent their anger from boiling into natural disasters such earthquakes and droughts Before communist rule China many villages still had shrines places worship dedicated nature gods

result would show that the person had carried out logging washing dirty things the forest and the family person concerned would have ask the Dongba priest hold the ritual near where the activity had taken place and apologise the nature god Shu Being conservative people the villagers prohibited logging and even the cutting tree branches and gathering dry pineneedles from the coniferous trees wasnt generally allowed The gathering pine needles was only allowed July when the forests were lush and green However only one person from each household was allowed this job order enforce fairness between households with more fewer labourers Dry pine needles are mixed with pig manure for fertilizer Green pine needles are used ground covering courtyards during celebrations The elders locally known Lao Min would watch all these activities The elders also voluntarily carried out the public affairs the village Traditionally they played important role which still influences many villages Especially
