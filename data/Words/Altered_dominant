altered chord chord which one more notes from the diatonic scale replaced with neighboring pitch from the chromatic scale According the broadest definition any chord with nondiatonic chord tone altered chord while the simplest use altered chords the use borrowed chords chords borrowed from the parallel key and the most common the use secondary dominants Alfred Blatter explainsAn altered chord occurs when one the standard functional chords given another quality the modification one more components the chord For example altered notes may used leading tones emphasize their diatonic neighbors Contrast this with chord extensions Whereas chord extension generally involves adding notes that are logically implied chord alteration involves changing some the typical notes This usually done dominant chords and the four alterations that are commonly used are the and Using one more these notes resolving dominant chord greatly increases the bite the chord and therefore the power the resolution jazz harmony chromatic alteration either the addition notes not the scale expansion chord progression adding extra nondiatonic chords For example major scale with added note for instance chromatically altered scale while one bar Cmaj7 moving Fmaj7 the next bar can chromatically altered adding the and Fmaj7 the second two beats bar one Techniques include the iiVI turnaround well movement halfstep minor third The five most common types altered dominants are V75 both raised fifths V75 both lowered fifths and lowered fifth and third Borrowing this type seen music from the Renaissance music era and the Baroque music era 16001750 such with the use the Picardy third which piece minor key has final intermediate cadence the tonic major chord Borrowing also common 20th century popular music and rock music For example music major key such major composers and songwriters may use major chord which borrowed from the key minor where the VII chord Similarly music minor key composers and songwriters often borrow chords from the tonic major For example pieces minor often use major and major and chords which are borrowed from the key major More advanced types altered chords were used Romantic music era composers the 19th century such Chopin and jazz composers and improvisers the 20th and 21st century For example the chord progression the left uses four unaltered chords while the progression the right uses altered chord and alteration the previous progression The the altered chord serves leading tone which the root the next chord The object such foreign tones enlarge and enrich the scale confirm the melodic tendency certain tones contradict the tendency others convert inactive tones into active leading tones and affiliate the keys increasing the number common tones According one definition when chord chromatically altered and the thirds remain large major small minor and not used modulation altered chord According another all chords having major third either triads sevenths ninths with the fifth chromatically raised chromatically lowered are altered chords while triads with single altered note are considered changes form quality rather than alteration According composer Percy Goetschius Altered chords contain one more tones written with accidentals and therefore foreign the scale which they appear but nevertheless from their connections and their effect obviously belonging the principal key their phrase Richard Franko Goldman argues that once one accepts the variability the scale the concept altered chords becomes unnecessary reality there nothing altered about them they are entirely natural elements single key system and not necessary use the term each altered chord simply one the possibilities regularly existing and employed Dan Haerle argues that only fifths and ninths may altered all other alterations may interpreted unaltered chord tone enharmonically altered fifth ninth for example and altered seventh chord seventh chord with one all its factors raised lowered semitone altered for example the augmented seventh chord featuring raised fifth C75 CEGB Most likely the fifth then the ninth then the thirteenthclarification needed All secondary dominants are altered chords classical music the raised fifth more common than the lowered fifth which dominant chord adds Phrygian flavor through the introduction altered dominant chord dominant triad 7th chord that contains raised lowered fifth and sometimes lowered 3rd According Dan Haerle Generally altered dominants can divided into three main groups altered 5th altered 9th and altered 5th and 9th This definition allows three five options including the original Alfred Music gives nine options for altered dominants the last four which contain two alterations each Pianist Noah Baerman writes that The point having altered note dominant chord build more tension leading correspondingly more powerful resolution jazz the term altered chord notated alt chord G7alt refers dominant chord which neither the fifth nor the ninth unalterednamely where the 5th and the 9th are raised lowered single semitone omitted Altered chords are thus constructed using the following notes some which may omitted Altered chords may include both flattened and sharpened form the altered fifth ninth G7559 however more common use only one such alteration per tone G759 G759 G759 G759 practice many fake books not specify all the alterations the chord typically just labelled G7alt and the alteration 9ths 11ths and 13ths left the artistic discretion the comping musician The use chords labeled G7alt can create challenges jazz ensembles where more than one chordal instrument are playing chords large band with electric guitar player and Hammond organ player because the guitarist might interpret G7alt chord containing and whereas the organ player may interpret the same chord containing and this can lead clashing harmonies deal with this issue bands with more than one chordal instrument may work out the alt chord voicings beforehand alternate playing choruses The choice inversion the omission certain tones within the chord omitting the root common jazz harmony and chord voicings can lead many different possible colorings substitutions and enharmonic equivalents Altered chords are ambiguous harmonically and may play variety roles depending such factors voicing modulation and voice leading The altered chords harmony built the altered scale which includes all the alterations shown the chord elements above Because they not have natural fifths altered dominant 7alt chords support tritone substitution substitution Thus the 7alt chord given root can substituted with the 1311 chord the root tritone away G7alt the same D1311
