Since the 20th century the book musical has been defined musical play where songs and dances are fully integrated into wellmade story with serious dramatic goals that able evoke genuine emotions other than laughter The three main components book musical are its music lyrics and book The book script musical refers the story character development and dramatic structure including the spoken dialogue and stage directions but can also refer the dialogue and lyrics together which are sometimes referred the libretto Italian for little book The music and lyrics together form the score musical and include songs incidental music and musical scenes which are theatrical sequences set music often combining song with spoken dialogue The interpretation musical the responsibility its creative team which includes director musical director usually choreographer and sometimes orchestrator musicals production also creatively characterized technical aspects such set design costumes stage properties props lighting and sound The creative team designs and interpretations generally change from the original production succeeding productions Some production elements however may retained from the original production for example Bob Fosses choreography Chicago There fixed length for musical While can range from short oneact entertainment several acts and several hours length even multievening presentation most musicals range from one and half three hours Musicals are usually presented two acts with one short intermission and the first act frequently longer than the second The first act generally introduces nearly all the characters and most the music and often ends with the introduction dramatic conflict plot complication while the second act may introduce few new songs but usually contains reprises important musical themes and resolves the conflict complication book musical usually built around four six main theme tunes that are reprised later the show although sometimes consists series songs not directly musically related Spoken dialogue generally interspersed between musical numbers although sung dialogue recitative may used especially socalled sungthrough musicals such Jesus Christ Superstar Les Misrables Evita and Hamilton Several shorter musicals Broadway and the West End have been presented one act recent decades Moments greatest dramatic intensity book musical are often performed song Proverbially when the emotion becomes too strong for speech you sing when becomes too strong for song you dance book musical song ideally crafted suit the character characters and their situation within the story although there have been times the history the musical from the 1890s the 1920s when this integration between music and story has been tenuous The New York Times critic Ben Brantley described the ideal song theatre when reviewing the 2008 revival Gypsy There separation all between song and character which what happens those uncommon moments when musicals reach upward achieve their ideal reasons Typically many fewer words are sung fiveminute song than are spoken fiveminute block dialogue Therefore there less time develop drama musical than straight play equivalent length since musical usually devotes more time music than dialogue Within the compressed nature musical the writers must develop the characters and the plot The material presented musical may original may adapted from novels Wicked and Man Mancha plays Hello Dolly and Carousel classic legends Camelot historical events Evita films The Producers and Billy Elliot the other hand many successful musical theatre works have been adapted for musical films such West Side Story Fair Lady The Sound Music Oliver and Chicago Musical theatre closely related the theatrical form opera but the two are usually distinguished weighing number factors First musicals generally have greater focus spoken dialogue This not hard and fast rule some musicals are entirely accompanied and sungthrough while some operas such Die Zauberflte and most operettas have some unaccompanied dialogue Second musicals also usually include more dancing essential part the storytelling particularly the principal performers well the chorus Third musicals often use various genres popular music least popular singing and musical styles Finally musicals usually avoid certain operatic conventions particular musical almost always performed the language its audience Musicals produced Broadway the West End for instance are invariably sung English even they were originally written another language While opera singer primarily singer and only secondarily actor and rarely needs dance musical theatre performer often actor first but must also singer and dancer Someone who equally accomplished all three referred triple threat Composers music for musicals often consider the vocal demands roles with musical theatre performers mind Today large theatres that stage musicals generally use microphones and amplification the actors singing voices way that would generally disapproved operatic context Some works George Gershwin Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim have been made into both musical theatre and operatic productions Similarly some older operettas light operas such The Pirates Penzance Gilbert and Sullivan have been produced modern adaptations that treat them musicals For some works production styles are almost important the works musical dramatic content defining into which art form the piece falls Sondheim said really think that when something plays Broadway its musical and when plays opera house its opera Thats Its the terrain the countryside the expectations the audience that make one thing another Although this article primarily concerns musical theatre works that are nonoperatic there remains overlap form between lighter operatic forms and more musically complex ambitious musicals practice often difficult distinguish among the various kinds musical theatre
